odo `v3.7.0` is now out!

<!--truncate-->

To install `odo`, follow [the installation guide](/docs/overview/installation).

## Notable Changes
Check this Playlist for an overview of the most notable changes in this release: [odo v3.7.0 (Sprint 231)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOotRYGDzmijWs2QFU2dJ4e8)

### Features

#### `odo logs` on Podman

To continue improving the feature parity between Kubernetes and Podman, [`odo logs`](../docs/command-reference/logs) is now supported on the latter.

Similarly to how `odo dev` requires specifying the target platform (using the `--platform` flag), `odo logs` also requires specifying the platform to display the logs of a component running on Podman, like so:

```
ODO_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=t odo logs --platform podman
```

As a reminder, Podman support in `odo` is still experimental and requires you to opt in if you want to try it out.

#### More details on forwarded ports in the output of `odo describe component`

[`odo describe component`](../docs/command-reference/describe-component) now additionally includes the following helpful information about forwarded ports:
- the endpoint name, as defined in the Devfile
- the endpoint exposure, as defined in the Devfile
- whether the port is a debug endpoint or not. Note that this is based upon a naming convention: the endpoint name in the Devfile should be `debug` or be prefixed with `debug-` to be considered as a debug endpoint.
