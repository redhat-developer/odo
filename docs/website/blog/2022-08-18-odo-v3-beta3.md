### Features

#### odo dev: react to changes as soon as possible ([#5933](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5933))

`odo dev` can now detect changes as soon as they occur. It works in a controller like mechanism, where it keeps a watch on certain resources, events and files, and constantly notifies user about the state of their application. 

#### Allow binding to services from other namespaces ([\#5936](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5936))

odo now allows binding to services from all the namespaces so that users can share services that are shared between multiple applications or developers.

#### Allow using remote Dockerfiles \(HTTP\(S\) only\) for building images ([\#5976](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5976))

User can now use remote Dockerfiles to build container images for their outer loop development cycle.

#### Performance improvements to odo logs ([\#5942](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5942), [\#5973](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5973), [\#5961](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5961))

We have attempted at improving the performance of `odo logs` this release with a delta of approximately 1s.
