`2.5.0` of odo has been released!

<!--truncate-->

## Notable changes in odo 2.5.0

### Support for ephemeral field in Devfile `volumes` definition ([#5279](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5279) [@feloy](https://github.com/feloy))

odo now supports Devfile volumes that are defined as ephemeral. If a volume is defined with `ephemeral: true` odo will create it as a Kubernetes `emptyDir` volume.

Example of an ephemeral volume definition inside `devfile.yaml`

```yaml
- name: volume-test
  volume:
    size: 1Gi
    ephemeral: true
```

### Delete outer loop resources with `odo delete --deploy`([PR#5276](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5276) [@valaparthvi](https://github.com/valaparthvi))

You can now delete resources that were deployed using odo deploy via the odo delete --deploy command.
`odo delete --all` now deletes everything from the cluster related to the given Devfile including outer loop resources.

|Delete command| Deletes resources from cluster | Deletes local `devfile.yaml` |
|-|-|-|
|`odo delete` | YES (deletes resources created using `odo push`) | NO |
|`odo delete --deploy` |YES (deletes resources created using `odo deploy`) | NO |
|`odo delete --all`| YES (deletes all resources created by odo) | YES|


### Add suppport for cpuLimit, cpuRequest and memoryRequest ([PR#5252](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5252) [@anandrkskd](https://github.com/anandrkskd))

odo now supports specifying additional resource constraints for `container` components in Devfile as introduced by Devfile v2.1.0.

You can use the following constraints:

| Devfile container field | Kubernetes equivalent in Pod specification (`spec.containers[].`)  | Description |
|-|-|-|
|`memoryLimit`| `resources.limits.memory` | Describes the maximum allowed memory for the container. |
|`memoryRequest`| `resources.requests.cpu`  | Describes the minimum memory that the container requires. |
|`cpuLimit`| `resources.limits.cpu` | Describes the maximum allowed CPU cores for the container  |
|`cpuRequest`| `resources.requests.cpu` | Describes the minimum number of CPU cores that the container requires. |

You can learn more about resource management in [Resource Management for Pods and Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) section in [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)

Example of a Devfile container with all available resource constraints:

```yaml
components:
  - name: runtime
    container:
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-12:1-36
      memoryLimit: 1024Mi
      memoryRequest: 512Mi
      cpuLimit: '1'
      cpuRequest: 200m
      endpoints:
        - name: "3000-tcp"
          targetPort: 3000
      mountSources: true
```

### Adds mapping support to odo link ([PR#5237](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5237) [@dharmit](https://github.com/dharmit))

You can specify custom Service Binding mappings using `odo link` command.

For example, with the following link command

```sh
odo link PostgresCluster/hippo --map pgVersion='{{ .database.spec.postgresVersion }}'
```

Odo will generate `ServiceBinding` resource similar to

```yaml
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: myapp-postgrescluster-hippo
spec:
  application:
    group: apps
    name: myapp-app
    resource: deployments
    version: v1
  bindAsFiles: false
  detectBindingResources: true
  mappings:
  - name: pgVersion
    value: '{{ .database.spec.postgresVersion }}'
  services:
  - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
    id: hippo
    kind: PostgresCluster
    name: hippo
    version: v1beta1
```
