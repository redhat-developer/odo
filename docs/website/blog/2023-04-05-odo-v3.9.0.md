### Deprecation notice

#### `odo registry --details` without `--devfile`

We are deprecating the usage of `odo registry --details` without `--devfile`.
Using `odo registry --details` without `--devfile` still works, but might take very long to return information.

`--details` allows to get more details about a specific Devfile stack, and was not intended to be used without specifying `--devfile`.

The correct usage of `odo registry --details` is by specifying the additional `--devfile` flag.

See the [command reference page](/docs/command-reference/registry/) for more details and examples.

### Features

#### Pod Security Admission support

Kubernetes v1.25 introduced [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) defining different isolation levels for Pods,
along with a Pod Security admission controller to enforce those standards.
Namespaces can be [labeled](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/enforce-standards-namespace-labels/) to enforce the Pod Security Standards,
meaning that a Pod can be rejected if it is not compliant with the security restrictions defined. 

See [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) for more details.

When used against a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, `odo` is now able to automatically detect if the current namespace has such restrictions enforced;
and if so, it can dynamically adjust the specifications of the Pods it creates such that they are approved by the Pod Security admission controller.
This applies to resources created automatically by the following `odo` commands:
- `odo dev`: Pod created by `odo` to spin up a Development session
- `odo deploy`: Kubernetes Jobs created by `odo` when invoking `exec` commands during `deploy` (see [How `odo` runs `exec` commands in Deploy mode](/docs/development/devfile#how-odo-runs-exec-commands-in-deploy-mode))

:::info
Bear in mind that you can always customize those resources through `pod-overrides` and `container-overrides` attributes in the Devfile.
See [Extending Kubernetes resources](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/overriding-pod-and-container-attributes).

#### Support for `autoBuild` and `deployByDefault` Devfile fields

To clarify which Devfile components should get created/applied automatically, the [Devfile](https://devfile.io/) specification introduced two new fields:
- `autoBuild` on [`Image`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-an-image-component#procedure) components;
- `deployByDefault` on [`Kubernetes`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-kubernetes-or-openshift-component#procedure) and [`OpenShift`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-kubernetes-or-openshift-component#procedure) components

`odo` now supports those fields, following the rules depicted in [our Devfile reference page](/docs/development/devfile#how-odo-determines-components-that-are-applied-automatically).

#### Component name added to `odo analyze`

`odo analyze` now includes a new `name` field in its output, representing the name of the application if was detected automatically or the current directory name.

See the [command reference page](/docs/command-reference/json-output#odo-analyze--o-json) for more details.

Example:

```diff
[
    {
        "devfile": "dotnet50",
        "ports": [
            3000
        ],
        "devfileRegistry": "DefaultDevfileRegistry",
-       "devfileVersion": "1.0.3"
+       "devfileVersion": "1.0.3",
+       "name": "my-dotnet-backend"
    }
]
```
