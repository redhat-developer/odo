Developers often need to customize their development environments to work with a specific project.
In many cases, this involves configuring a stack of tools and libraries to work together seamlessly.
Fortunately, a Devfile is a single configuration file that can set up an entire development environment with dependencies and services.

By default, the Devfile Registry provides a set of pre-defined Stacks that developers can use to set up development environments quickly.
These stacks provide a solid foundation to build upon and can save developers a tremendous amount of time.

However, the predefined stacks may not always suit your needs.
In this blog post, we'll explore how to write your own Devfile from scratch to fit your project's needs better. 
This is also a great opportunity to look more closely at the Devfile structure and how it works.

We'll write a Devfile for Backstage as an example.


<!--truncate-->

Backstage recommends using NodeJS 18 and requires Yarn.
At the time of writing, no Devfile in Devfile Registry is using NodeJS 18 or Yarn.
If you are in a situation like this, writing Devfile on your own makes more sense instead of starting with Devfile from the registry that has nothing in common with what you need.

First, we will need Backstage source code. If you have an existing Backstage project, you can use that, or you can follow [Backstage Getting Started](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/) Guide (TL;DR: if you already have NodeJS installed, run `npx @backstage/create-app@latest`)

Now we can start creating a new `devfile.yaml`.

## Structure of a Devfile
Create a new file called `devfile.yaml` in the Backstage root directory and open it in your favorite IDE or editor.
We will start with a basic structure of the Devfile and some metadata.


```yaml
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
metadata:
  name: my-backstage

commands:

components:

```

Two most important sections in Devfile are `commands` and `containers`.

### Components

[`components`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-components) section is a list of components that our development environment is composed of.
There are different types of components available in Devfile.
- [`container`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-container-component) - this is probably the most common component type. Most Devfiles will have at least one container component.
This allows us to define containers in which the `exec` commands should be executed, 
or it can be used to define containers that run additional services that our application requires.
- [`kubernetes`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-kubernetes-or-openshift-component) - this component allows us to create any Kubernetes resource.
Kubernetes resource can be either directly in-lined in the Devfile or referenced by URI.
- [`image`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-an-image-component) - this component can be used to build images from Dockerfile.
It can be combined with the `container` component. The `image` component creates a container image,
 which can later be used in `container` definition.
- [`volume`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-volume-component) - this component is used with `container` components and allows us to create volumes.
Volumes can be used to ensure persistence across container restarts,
or to share data between containers. In Kubernetes world Devfile volume is usually translated into `PersistentVolumeClaim`.



Let's start with adding our first component of a type `container`.
In this example, it will be the only `component` we will use.

```yaml
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
metadata:
  name: my-backstage

commands:

components:
# highlight-start
  - name: nodejs
    container:
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/nodejs-18:latest
      sourceMapping: /projects
      command: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
      memoryLimit: 2Gi
      endpoints:
        - name: frontend
          targetPort: 3000
          exposure: public
        - name: backend
          targetPort: 7007
          exposure: public
# highlight-end

```


Here is an explanation of what each line does.
- `image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/nodejs-18:latest` - defines an image that will be used to create a container.
Here we are using [Red Hat's NodeJS image](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi9/nodejs-18/62e8e7ed22d1d3c2dfe2ca01?container-tabs=dockerfile).
- `sourceMapping: /projects` - defines where in the container the source code of our application will be.
`odo dev` process makes sure that the local source code is pushed to this location in the container. 
- `command: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']` - this will be the main command in the container.
In this example the command does nothing; it is there to override the default image command to make
sure that the container stays running and we execute our commands inside it.
- `memoryLimit: 2Gi` - ensure that we have enough memory to build and run our application
- `endpoints` - define what ports should be exposed and how.
  For example, the next block defines that port `3000` should be exposed as `public`.
  Public means that the port can be accessible from outside of the cluster.
 ```yaml
    - name: frontend
        targetPort: 3000
        exposure: public
  ``` 


### Commands

[`commands`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-commands) section defines actions that can be performed.
There are three types of commands `exec`, `apply`, and `composite`.

- [`exec`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-an-exec-command) - this just executes the command defined in `commandLine` inside the `container`.
  The `container` needs to be defined in `components` section.
- [`apply`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-an-apply-command) - most commonly coupled with `kubernets` component. It creates or, in other words, applies the component referenced in this command. 
- [`composite`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-composite-command) - this command can be used to execute multiple existing commands sequentially or in parallel.



Let's add commands to our Defile.


```yaml
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
metadata:
  name: my-backstage

commands:
# highlight-start
  - id: yarn-install
    exec:
      commandLine: npx yarn install
      component: nodejs
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      group:
        kind: build
        isDefault: true
    
  - id: run-dev
    exec:
      commandLine: npx yarn run dev
      component: nodejs
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      group:
        kind: run
        isDefault: true
# highlight-end

components:
  - name: nodejs
    container:
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/nodejs-18:latest
      sourceMapping: /projects
      command: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
      memoryLimit: 2Gi
      endpoints:
        - name: frontend
          targetPort: 3000
          exposure: public
        - name: backend
          targetPort: 7007
          exposure: public
```


We have added two commands `yarn-install` and `run-dev`. Let's use the first one to explain what each line means.
- `commandLine: npx yarn install` - this defines that the command `npx yarn install` should be executed when Devfile command
  `yarn-install` is executed.
- `component: nodejs` - this defines in which `container` component the command defined in `commandLine` should be executed.
- `workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}` - defines in what working directory the command will be executed.
  Here we are using `${PROJECT_SOURCE}` variable. This variable will always point to the root directory with the source code.
  This will be the same path as we used in `sourceMapping` in the `container` component
- `group:` - defines to what group this command belongs to. There are `build`, `run`, `debug`, `test`, `deploy`.
  ```yaml
        kind: build
        isDefault: true
  ```
  The previous block defines that this command belongs to `build` group and is the default command. 
  Each group can have only one default command. When you run `odo dev`, odo automatically executes the default command in `build` group first,
 followed by the default command in `run` group.
 
 
Ideally, this would be all we need, and you could use this Devfile with odo.

## Fixing issues
If you try to use Devfile as we have it, you will see an error.
The first problem is that the NodeJS image doesn't have `yarn` installed. 

### Install `yaml` into the container
To add yarn, we will leverage Devfile feature called [`events`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-event-bindings).
Events allow us to define commands that should be executed on predefined events. 
There are 3 events that you can use.
- `preStart` - executed before the main container is started.
- `postStart` - executed after the main container is started.
- `preStop` - executed before the main container is stopped.

In our case we will use `preStart` event and execute `npm install -g yarn`.


```yaml
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
metadata:
  name: my-backstage

commands:
# highlight-start
  - id: install-yarn
    exec:
      commandLine: npm install -g yarn
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      component: nodejs
# highlight-end
  - id: yarn-install
    exec:
      commandLine: npx yarn install
      component: nodejs
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      group:
        kind: build
        isDefault: true
    
  - id: run-start
    exec:
      commandLine: npx yarn run dev
      component: nodejs
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      group:
        kind: run
        isDefault: true
    
components:
  - name: nodejs
    container:
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/nodejs-18:latest
      sourceMapping: /projects
      command: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
      memoryLimit: 2Gi
      endpoints:
        - name: frontend
          targetPort: 3000
          exposure: public
        - name: backend
          targetPort: 7007
          exposure: public
# highlight-start
events:
  postStart:
    - install-yarn
# highlight-end
```

Even after installing `yarn` you won't be able to use this Devfile with odo and Backstage source code.


### No space left on device 
You will get `NOSPC: no space left on device` error.

This is due to the [#6836](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6836) issue in odo.
At the time of writing this, odo creates a 2GB volume for the source code. For Backstage and it's `node_modules`
this is not enough. Luckily, there is a simple workaround that we can do in Devfile.

We can create extra volume just for `/projects/node_modules`. This will put `node_modules` into a separate volume form the source code.



Full Devfile should look like this


```yaml
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
metadata:
  name: my-backstage

commands:
  - id: install-yarn
    exec:
      commandLine: npm install -g yarn
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      component: nodejs

  - id: yarn-install
    exec:
      commandLine: npx yarn install
      component: nodejs
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      group:
        kind: build
        isDefault: true
    
  - id: run-start
    exec:
      commandLine: npx yarn run dev
      component: nodejs
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      group:
        kind: run
        isDefault: true
    
components:
  - name: nodejs
    container:
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/nodejs-18:latest
      sourceMapping: /projects
      command: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
      memoryLimit: 2Gi
      # highlight-start
      # workaround for https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6836
      volumeMounts:
        - name: node-modules
          path: /projects/node_modules
      # highlight-end
      endpoints:
        - name: frontend
          targetPort: 3000
          exposure: public
        - name: backend
          targetPort: 7007
          exposure: public
  # highlight-start  
  - name: node-modules
    volume:
      size: 3Gi 
  # highlight-end   

events:
  postStart:
    - install-yarn
```

Now we have completed our `devfile.yaml` for Backstage.
To use it with Backstage we will need more than just running `odo dev`.
We must provide additional flags to ensure that Backstage's frontend and backend can communicate.
From the Devfile you can see that there are two ports. 3000 for frontend and 7007 for backend.
In default configuration frontend expects that the backend is reachable on `localhost:7007`.
With odo, we can use `--port-forward` flag to ensure that our local port `7007` is redirected to the backend,
for the consistency we will also redirect our local port `3000` to the frontend. 

```
odo dev --port-forward 3000:3000 --port-forward 7007:7007
```
You should now be able to access Backstage on `127.0.0.1:3000`.
