### Features

#### [`--port-forward` to define custom port mapping and `--address` to define a custom address for port forwarding during `odo dev`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6479)
To enhance the port forwarding feature provided by `odo dev`, you can now use custom port mapping with flag `--port-forward` and a custom address for ports to listen by passing `--address` flag.
Read more about [custom port mapping](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/dev/#using-custom-port-mapping-for-port-forwarding) and [custom address](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/dev/#using-custom-address-for-port-forwarding) on `odo dev` command reference doc.

Custom Port Mapping for port forwarding:

#### [Automatically mounting volumes, configmaps, and secrets](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6549)
You can now automatically mount existing persistent volumes, configmaps and secrets to your `odo dev` deployment by applying an appropriate label to them.
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    devfile.io/auto-mount: "true"
```

Read more about it in [Automounting Volumes](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/advanced/automounting-volumes).

#### [Support variable substitution for `odo build-images`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6274)
`odo build-images` now supports the Devfile variable substitution in a similar way as `odo dev` and `odo deploy`.

Read more about it in the [`odo build-images` command reference doc](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/build-images#substituting-variables).

#### [`odo dev` can run simultaneously on podman and cluster](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6494)

### Bugs

#### [Allow to cancel `odo dev` execution at any phase](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6196)
In the previous versions, `odo dev` could not be cancelled until the build phase was complete. This has now been fixed to allow cancelling `odo dev` at any phase.

#### [`odo dev` handles failing build commands in a better way.](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6196)
Build command is ideally the first command that is run after the necessary resources are created in the `odo dev` workflow. Read [How odo works](https://odo.dev/docs/development/architecture/how-odo-works#how-odo-dev-works) for a better understanding of this.

In the previous versions, `odo dev` would run the build command in an infinite loop until it succeeded, which was unnecessary. In v3.10.0 however, `odo dev` stops after 1 unsuccessful attempt, and waits for the user to make changes to the project, providing with a slightly better user experience.

#### [PodSecurity Admission: Display duplicate warnings only once](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6699)
Warnings related to PodSecurity Admission are now printed only once.

#### [Wait until expected ports are opened before starting port-forwarding](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6667)
`odo dev` now waits until the application ports are listening before printing the port forwarding information.
