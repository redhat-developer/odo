## Notable Changes
Check this Playlist for an overview of the most notable changes in this release: [odo v3.5.0 (Sprint 229)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOoGCUFCbqxnQclhnHA0L73D)

### Features

#### `odo delete component` deletes component running on podman

When you run `odo dev` on podman platform, pressing ctrl-c will delete the resources from podman. 

If `odo dev` does not delete the reosurces as expected (because it failed unexpectedly, it has been killed with the KILL(9) signal, etc), you can use `odo delete component` to delete the resources. 

Note that you need to run odo in the experimental mode for this feature.

#### `odo describe component` describes component running on podman

You can now get the description of a component running on podman with the command `odo describe component`.

Note that you need to run odo in the experimental mode for this feature.

#### Allow fetching a specific Devfile Stack version

Version 3.4.0 of odo introduced the support of versioned Devfile stacks, with the ability to list available versions od Devfile stacks. Starting with version 3.5.0, you can initialize a new project with a specific version of a Devfile stack. Previously, the default version were used.

#### Enable ImageStream resolving

If you are developing on an OpenShift cluster, `odo dev` can now use images from ImageStreams defined in your cluster, without any configuration.
