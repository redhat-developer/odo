### `odo` on Podman out of Experimental mode

Starting with `odo` v3.8.0, you can use the Podman platform for your development, without the need to enter the experimental mode of `odo`.

The following commands are supporting the Podman platform:

- `odo dev --platform podman`
- `odo logs --platform podman`
- `odo list component`
- `odo describe component`
- `odo delete component`

### Detecting in-cluster Devfile registries

`odo` traditionally gets the list of Devfile Registries to work with from a preference file saved on the user's machine. Starting with v3.8.0, `odo` will also fetch a list of Devfile registries defined into the cluster.

### Support Exec command for Deploy

`odo` can now execute any command when running the `deploy` command.
