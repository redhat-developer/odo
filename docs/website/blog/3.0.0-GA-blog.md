`odo` v3 is now GA! 🎉

![](../static/img/logo_small.png)
<!--truncate-->
Are you an application developer wanting to work closely with a production-like environment? 
Pressured on time due to the steep learning curve involved in cluster development?

`odo` is here to answer your problems!


Over the past couple of months, the `odo` team has been developing better experiences on working with applications and container clusters.

## So, what's new?

`odo` v3 comes with a new set of commands that replaces the old ones but essentially does the same thing, in a faster and more efficient way.

### odo init
`odo init` allows you to generate example code or fetch an appropriate [Devfile](https://devfile.io/docs/2.1.0/what-is-a-devfile) for your existing project.

```shell
  __
 /  \__     Initializing a new component
 \__/  \    Files: Source code detected, a Devfile will be determined based upon source code autodetection
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0
 \__/

Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
Based on the files in the current directory odo detected
Language: javascript
Project type: nodejs
The devfile "nodejs" from the registry "StagingRegistry" will be downloaded.
? Is this correct? Yes
 ✓  Downloading devfile "nodejs" from registry "StagingRegistry" [3s]

↪ Container Configuration "runtime":
  OPEN PORTS:
    - 3000
  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
? Enter component name: my-node-app

Your new component 'my-node-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
```

_How is it different from the `odo create` command of v2?_
* [Detect the appropriate Devfile](#detect-the-appropriate-devfile)
* [Personalize Devfile configuration](#personalize-devfile-configuration)

#### Detect the appropriate Devfile
`odo init` will automatically analyze your directory and based on the project type, suggest an appropriate Devfile for use.

#### Personalize Devfile configuration
`odo init` also provides a better interactive way to configure your Devfile according to your project requirement. With this feature, you can modify the environment variables exported to and ports exposed by your application on the cluster.

### odo dev
`odo dev` allows you to build, run, debug and test your application on the cluster in a continuous workflow.

```shell
$ odo dev
  __
 /  \__     Developing using the "my-node-app" Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: default
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0
 \__/

↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 •  Waiting for Kubernetes resources  ...
 ⚠  Pod is Pending
 ✓  Pod is Running
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [172ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster (command: install) [11s]
 •  Executing the application (command: run)  ...
 -  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 3000


↪ Dev mode
 Status:
 Watching for changes in the current directory /tmp/pd

 Keyboard Commands:
[Ctrl+c] - Exit and delete resources from the cluster
     [p] - Manually apply local changes to the application on the cluster
```

_How is it different from the `odo push` command of v2?_

`odo` v3 combines the `odo push` and `odo watch` commands from v2 into a single `odo dev` command.

Additionally the command provides:
* [Continuous workflow](#continuous-workflow)
* [Manual trigger to apply local changes on the cluster](#manual-trigger-to-apply-local-changes-on-the-cluster)
* [Resource cleanup](#resource-cleanup)
* [Better watch system](#better-watch-system)
* [Port forwarding to access the application](#port-forwarding-to-access-the-application)

#### Continuous workflow
`odo dev` is a non-terminating command that runs until the user hits `Ctrl+c`. It continuously watches the directory for any new changes (including the changes occurring in the Devfile) and automatically syncs them with the application running on the cluster. 

#### Manual trigger to apply local changes on the cluster
By default, `odo dev` automatically detects any new change in the directory, and syncs it with the application running on the cluster, but it is possible to do this trigger manually by running the command with a `--no-watch` flag and pressing `p` to trigger the sync.

#### Better watch system
`odo dev` continuously monitors the resources created to run the application on the cluster and ensures that the application stays running.

#### Resource cleanup
Before exiting, `odo dev` will cleanup any resources that it created for running the application on the cluster.

#### Port forwarding to access the application
`odo dev` uses port-forwarding to allow application access instead of Routes and Ingress that were used in `odo push`, making it much easier to access the application.

Read this section to learn more: [What happened to Ingress/Route?](/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide#what-happened-to-ingressroute)

### odo add binding

`odo add binding` allows the application to connect to an [Operator](https://operatorhub.io) Backed service.

```shell
$ odo add binding
? Do you want to list services from: current namespace
? Select service instance you want to bind to: cluster-sample (Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io)
? Enter the Binding's name: my-node-app-cluster-sample
? How do you want to bind the service? Bind As Files
? Select naming strategy for binding names: DEFAULT
 ✓  Successfully added the binding to the devfile.
Run `odo dev` to create it on the cluster.
You can automate this command by executing:
  odo add binding --service cluster-sample.Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io --name my-node-app-cluster-sample
```

_How is it different from the `odo link` command of v2?_
* [Interactive mode](#interactive-mode)
* [Ability to connect to a service in any namespace](#ability-to-connect-to-a-service-in-any-namespace)
* [Run from anywhere](#run-from-anywhere)
* [Work without a running application](#work-without-a-running-application)
* [Only supports Bindable Operators](#only-supports-bindable-operators)
* [Requires the Service Binding Operator](#requires-the-service-binding-operator)

#### Interactive mode
`odo add binding` provides an interactive mode that lists bindable service across all the namespaces, and a way to personalize related configuration, making the experience better.

#### Ability to connect to a service in any namespace
`odo add binding` allows the application to connect to any bindable service in any namespace, it does not necessarily have to be in the same namespace as the application.

#### Run from anywhere
`odo add binding` can be run from anywhere and does not require access to a Devfile in order to work. With this method, you can either: directly create the Service Binding on the cluster, write the YAML to a file, or simply display it.

#### Work without a running application
As opposed to v2, `odo add binding` no longer requires the application to be running on the cluster, making it even faster.

#### Only supports Bindable Operators

`odo link` could link an application to another application and any Operator Backed service, but as of now, v3 only supports connecting to services that are backed by Operators considered [bindable](https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator#known-bindable-operators) by the Service Binding Operator.

Based on the user feedback, we might work on adding these features back, but as of now there are no plans of implementing them.

Regardless, there are workarounds to connect to another application
or non-bindable service, read [this blog](./2022-06-14-binding-external-service.md) to know how.

#### Requires the Service Binding Operator

`odo add binding` requires that the Service Binding Operator is installed on the cluster before it is run. The command relies on the Operator to provide it with a list of Bindable services.

However, this will be fixed in the future releases.

### odo deploy

`odo deploy` allows you to run the outerloop of your development cycle.
Once you are satisfied with your application development locally, and are now ready to show your application to the world, you can use `odo deploy` to move to the next stage.

```shell
$ odo deploy
  __
 /  \__     Deploying the application using "my-node-app" Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: my-node-app
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0
 \__/

#### `odo dev` vs `odo deploy`
You might find yourself wondering how `odo dev` is different from `odo deploy` and when should you use the either one, you can read [this article](/docs/overview/dev_and_deploy) to get an answer to that question.


### odo registry

`odo registry` now lists all the Devfiles available in the Devfile registries that are added to your system.
```shell
$ odo registry

_How is it different from `odo registry` command of v2?_

`odo registry` of v2 was useful in creating/deleting/updating/listing Devfile registries, however in v3, this command can now be used to list the Devfiles.

Additionally, it also provides,
* [Filtering the devfiles](#filtering-the-devfiles)
* [Detailed information about the Devfiles](#detailed-information-about-the-devfiles)

#### Filtering the Devfiles
`odo registry` can filter the list of Devfiles based on a keyword (`--filter`), a Devfile registry (`--devfile-registry`), or the Devfile name (`--devfile`).

#### Detailed information about the Devfiles
`odo registry` can provide a detailed information about all the Devfiles by running it with `--details` flag.

### odo list
`odo list` lists all the resources created by `odo` including components, and bindings.

```shell
$ odo list
 ✓  Listing resources from the namespace "my-percona-server-mongodb-operator" [302ms]
 NAME              PROJECT TYPE  RUNNING IN  MANAGED
 my-node-app         nodejs        Deploy      odo (v3.0.0)
 my-go-app         go            Dev         odo (v3.0.0-rc1)
 mongodb-instance  Unknown       None        percona-server-mongodb-operator 

Bindings:
 NAME                        APPLICATION                 SERVICES                                                   RUNNING IN 
 my-go-app-mongodb-instance  my-go-app-app (Deployment)  mongodb-instance (PerconaServerMongoDB.psmdb.percona.com)  Dev
```


_How is it different from `odo list` of v2?_
* [Better information](#better-information)
* [Ability to list Bindings](#ability-to-list-bindings)

#### Better information
`odo list` gives a better experience by providing information about your application such as the mode it is running in, what tool and version are managing it, and the project type.

It further provides subcommands such as `odo list components`, and `odo list bindings` to list respective resources.

#### Ability to list Bindings
`odo list` provides a way to list the bindings created on the cluster by `odo`.

## Migrating from v2 to v3
The changes from v2 to v3 have been huge, but that does not have to mean big changes for you. We have [documented the migration process](/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide) to ease things for you.

The migration doc also documents the commands that have been [added, modified or removed from v3](/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide/#commands-added-modified-or-removed-in-v3).
