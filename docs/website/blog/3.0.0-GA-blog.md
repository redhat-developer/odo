odo v3 is now GA! 🎉

![](../static/img/logo_small.png)

Are you an application developer wanting to work closely with a production like environment? But can't, because you either don't have the time or energy to dive in the steep learning curve involved in running your application to the cluster?

odo is here to answer your problems!


Over the past couple of months odo team has been working on creating a better experience with odo.

## So what's new?

odo v3 comes with a new set of commands that replaces the old ones but essentially do the same thing, in a faster and efficient way.

### odo init
`odo init` allows you to fetch a [Devfile](https://devfile.io/docs/2.1.0/what-is-a-devfile) for your project.

```shell
  __
 /  \__     Initializing a new component
 \__/  \    Files: Source code detected, a Devfile will be determined based upon source code autodetection
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0
 \__/

Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
Based on the files in the current directory odo detected
Language: javascript
Project type: nodejs
The devfile "nodejs" from the registry "StagingRegistry" will be downloaded.
? Is this correct? Yes
 ✓  Downloading devfile "nodejs" from registry "StagingRegistry" [3s]

↪ Container Configuration "runtime":
  OPEN PORTS:
    - 3000
  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
? Enter component name: my-node-app

Your new component 'my-node-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
```

What sets this apart from `odo create` on odo v2?
* Detect appropriate Devfile
* Personalize Devfile configuration

#### Detect appropriate Devfile
`odo init` can analyze your directory and suggest an appropriate Devfile to use.

#### Personalize Devfile configuration
`odo init` also provides an interactive way to configure your Devfile according to your project requirement. With this feature, you can modify the environment variables exported to and ports exposed by your application on the cluster.

### odo dev
`odo dev` allows you to code, build, run, debug and test your application on the cluster in a continuous workflow.

```shell
$ odo dev
  __
 /  \__     Developing using the "my-node-app" Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: default
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0
 \__/

↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 •  Waiting for Kubernetes resources  ...
 ⚠  Pod is Pending
 ✓  Pod is Running
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [172ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster (command: install) [11s]
 •  Executing the application (command: run)  ...
 -  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 3000


↪ Dev mode
 Status:
 Watching for changes in the current directory /tmp/pd

 Keyboard Commands:
[Ctrl+c] - Exit and delete resources from the cluster
     [p] - Manually apply local changes to the application on the cluster
```

What sets this apart from `odo push` of odo v2?
odo v3 combines the `odo push` and `odo watch` commands from odo v2 into a single `odo dev` command.

Additionally it also provides,
* Continuous workflow
* Manual trigger to apply local changes on the cluster
* Resource cleanup
* Better watch system


#### Continuous workflow
`odo dev` is a non-terminating command that runs until user hits Ctrl+c. It continuously watches the directory for any new changes, and automatically syncs them with the application running on the cluster. 

#### Manual trigger to apply local changes on the cluster
By default, `odo dev` automatically detects any new change in the directory (this includes any changes that occur to the Devfile), and syncs it with the application running on the cluster, but it is possible to do this trigger manually by running the command with a `--no-watch` flag and pressing `p` to trigger the sync.

#### Better watch system
`odo dev` continuously monitors the resources created to run the application on the cluster, and ensures that the application always stays running.

#### Resource cleanup
Before exiting, `odo dev` will cleanup any resources that were created for running the application on the cluster.


### odo add binding

`odo add binding` allows the application to connect to an Operator Backed service.

```shell
$ odo add binding
? Do you want to list services from: current namespace
? Select service instance you want to bind to: cluster-sample (Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io)
? Enter the Binding's name: my-node-app-cluster-sample
? How do you want to bind the service? Bind As Files
? Select naming strategy for binding names: DEFAULT
 ✓  Successfully added the binding to the devfile.
Run `odo dev` to create it on the cluster.
You can automate this command by executing:
  odo add binding --service cluster-sample.Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io --name my-node-app-cluster-sample
```

What sets it apart from `odo link` command of odo v2?
* Interactive mode
* Ability to connect to a service in any namespace
* Run from anywhere
* Does not require a running application
* Only supports Bindable Operators
* Requires Service Binding Operator

#### Interactive mode
`odo add binding` provides a very nice interactive mode that lists bindable service across all the namespaces, and provides a way to personalize related configuration, making the experience nicer.

#### Ability to connect to a service in any namespace
`odo add binding` now allows the application to connect to any bindable service in any namespace, it doesn't necessarily have to be in the same namespace as the application.

#### Run from anywhere
`odo add binding` can be run from anywhere and does not require access to a Devfile in order to work. With this method, you can either directly create the Service Binding on the cluster, write the YAML to a file, or simply display it.

#### Does not require a running application
As opposed to `odo link` of v2, `odo add binding` does not require for the application be running on the cluster, making it faster.

#### Only supports Bindable Operators

As opposed to v2, where `odo link` could link an application to another application and any Operator Backed service, as of now, v3 only supports connecting to services that are backed by Operators that are considered [bindable](https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator#known-bindable-operators) by the Service Binding Operator.

Based on the user feedback, we might work on adding these features back, but as of now they are not implemented.

Regardless, there are workarounds to connect to another application
or non-bindable service, read [this blog](https://odo.dev/blog/binding-external-service-with-odo-v3) to know how.

#### Requires Service Binding Operator

`odo add binding` requires that the Service Binding Operator is installed before it is run. The command relies on the operator to provide it with a list of Bindable services.

This will be fixed in the future releases.

### odo deploy

`odo deploy` allows you to run the outerloop of your development cycle.
Once you are satisfied with your application development locally, and are now ready to show your application to the world, you can use `odo deploy` to move to the next stage.

```shell
$ odo deploy
  __
 /  \__     Deploying the application using my-nodejs Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: my-node-app
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0-rc1
 \__/

#### `odo dev` vs `odo deploy`
You might find yourself wondering how `odo dev` is different from `odo deploy` and when should you use the either one, you can read [this article](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/dev_and_deploy) to get an answer that question.


### odo registry

`odo registry` now lists all the devfiles available by the devfile registries that are added to your system.

How is it different from `odo registry` command of odo v2?
`odo registry` of v2 was only useful in creating/deleting/updating/listing Devfile registries, however in v3, this command can be used to list the devfiles.

Additionally, it also provides:
* Filtering the devfiles
* Detailed information about a devfile

#### Filtering the devfiles
It is possible to filter the list of devfiles based on a keyword(`--filter`), a devfile registry(`--devfile-registry`), or the devfile name(`--devfile`).

#### Detailed information about a devfile
You can get detailed information about a devfile by running the command with `--details` flag.

### Migrating from v2 to v3
The changes from v2 to v3 have been huge, but that does not have to mean big changes for you. We have articulated the migration process in this [migration doc](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide) to ease things for you.

The migration doc also documents the commands that have been [added, modified or removed from v3](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide/#commands-added-modified-or-removed-in-v3).
