### Features

#### Experimental Mode ([#6150](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6150))

There is now an Experimental Mode in `odo` that can be enabled by exporting `ODO_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=true` to your environment. All the new features will be generally available under this mode, giving you an opportunity to try them out sooner.

#### `odo dev` using Podman  ([#6151](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6151))
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmN_hGkOHX4?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOr5pjbPTdcWsIrOezCPXWdX" title="odo dev using podman" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can now use`odo dev` to run your application on Podman. `odo` leverages the benefit of Podman to work seamlessly with Kubernetes YAML and replicate them to containers locally.
This is an experimental feature and can be used with `--run-on` flag.

#### `odo list namespaces` is now available in JSON format ([\#6257](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6257))

#### `odo describe component` can now list Routes/Ingresses ([\#5990](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5990))

Applications deployed in the `Deploy` mode often include resources such as Routes (on OpenShift) and Ingresses (on Kubernetes) to allow access to an application.
`odo describe component` can now list these resources.
