### Features

#### Experimental Mode ([#6150](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6150))

There is now an Experimental Mode in `odo` that can be enabled by exporting `ODO_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=true` to your environment. All the new features will be generally available under this mode, giving you an opportunity to try them out sooner.
Learn more about the experimental mode in [this doc](../docs/user-guides/advanced/experimental-mode).

#### `odo dev` using Podman  ([#6151](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6151))

You can now use`odo dev` to run your application on Podman. `odo` leverages the benefit of Podman to work seamlessly with Kubernetes YAML and replicate them to containers locally.
This is an experimental feature and can be used with `--run-on` flag.

#### `odo list namespaces` is now available in JSON format ([\#6257](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6257))

#### `odo describe component` can now list Routes/Ingresses ([\#5990](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5990))

Applications deployed in the `Deploy` mode often include resources such as Routes (on OpenShift) and Ingresses (on Kubernetes) to allow access to an application.
`odo describe component` can now list these resources.
