`2.0.1` of odo has been released!

<!--truncate-->

### What's new


#### Secure starter project support

With this release, you can now deploy a component directly from a secure registry.

```sh
$ odo create nodejs --registry <secure registry name> --starter --starter-token <starter project token>
```

#### App comands

A series of new commands have been added to `app`.

You can now `list`, `describe` and `delete` an app with the following commands:

```sh
  $ odo app list
  $ odo app describe <app-name>
  $ odo app delete <app-name>
```

#### PROJECT_SOURCE env variables

`PROJECT_SOURCE` now works as an environment variable when specifying a `workingDir` inside a `devfile.yaml`.

```sh
 $ export PROJECT_SOURCE=/tmp/foobar/
```

```yaml
- exec:
    commandLine: mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/home/user/.m2/repository spring-boot:run
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
```
