### Features

#### Nightly binaries

To make it easier to try out new features of `odo`, you no longer need to wait until a new version is released.
We now publish nightly builds of `odo` with any changes that have been merged into the `main` branch at that time.

:::caution
Bear in mind that such builds are provided as is and might be highly unstable.
:::

Find out more on the [installation page](/docs/overview/installation#nightly-builds) for instructions on how to download and install nightly builds.

#### Full control over the application lifecycle with `odo dev --no-commands` and `odo run` 

Prior to v3.12.0, `odo dev` would implicitly run the `build` and `run`/`debug` commands automatically, and users had no control over the commands execution.
To give users more control over the lifecycle of their applications, we wanted to make it possible to not only start a Dev Session without any assumptions on the commands,
but also to run any command manually at any time.

The new `--no-commands` option allows to start a Dev Session without implicitly running the `build` and `run`/`debug` commands,
and the new `odo run` command allows to run any command from the Devfile against an already-running Dev session.

To make the most out of this workflow, users can:
1. start a Dev session without executing any commands, with [`odo dev --no-commands`](/docs/command-reference/dev#running-with-no-commands)

2. at any time, and in a separate terminal, run any commands defined in the Devfile, with [`odo run`](/docs/command-reference/run)

To make it easier to discover all the commands that are defined in the Devfile, we will be changing the output of `odo describe component`,
to display the list of commands from the Devfile.
[This](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6892) will be available in the upcoming v3.13.0, but you can already give it a try by
downloading a [nightly build](/docs/overview/installation#nightly-builds).


#### Syncing `.git` directory is now possible when running `odo dev`

`odo dev` now has a new `--sync-git-dir` option, allowing to synchronize the `.git` folder (which might be huge) into the Dev container.
By default, the `.git` folder is not synchronized, but this option can be helpful for applications that rely on the Git history.

#### JSON output for `odo version` and Podman version if available

`odo version` now displays the version of Podman if available, which should allow users to determine if they can use `odo` against Podman or not.
Note that we have a timeout of `1s` for Podman to return a response, otherwise it will be considered unavailable.
But this value is configurable via the [`PODMAN_CMD_INIT_TIMEOUT` environment variable](/docs/overview/configure#environment-variables-controlling-odo-behavior).

We are also adding JSON support for the output of `odo version`. Find out more on the [JSON Output](/docs/command-reference/json-output#odo-version--o-json) documentation.


#### [Experimental] API Server to control a running `odo dev` session

To make it easier to interact with Dev Sessions, we are introducing an experimental feature of starting an API Server based off of [this OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/blob/main/ododevapispec.yaml).
The rationale behind this is to simplify interactions with running Dev Sessions, while paving the way to building awesome things on top of this API server.

At the moment, we have endpoints for:
- controlling the `odo dev` instance (getting details about it, or even stop it)
- getting details about the running component and its Devfile
- sending requests for re-pushing, exactly as if the `p` key was pressed in the terminal running `odo dev`

See the demo below for more details:

Note that this is currently an opt-in feature. To try it out, please enable the experimental mode and run `odo dev` with the `--api-server` flag, e.g.:

```shell
ODO_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=t odo dev --api-server
```
