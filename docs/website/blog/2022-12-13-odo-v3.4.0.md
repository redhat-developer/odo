### Potentially breaking changes

#### Output of `odo list services -o json`

The `group` field has been removed from the JSON output of `odo list services` and is now superseded by a new `apiVersion` field
(containing information about both the `group` and `version`).

The `service` field has also been updated to include information about the `version`.

See [#6347](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6347) for more details.

Example:

```diff
 {
   "bindableServices": [
     {
       "name": "cluster-sample",
       "namespace": "cmd-describe-list-binding-test549cmw",
       "kind": "Cluster",
-      "group": "postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io",
-      "service": "cluster-sample/Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io"
+      "apiVersion": "postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1",
+      "service": "cluster-sample/Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1"
     }
   ]
 }
```

### Features

#### Using `odo` with Podman

Based on your valuable feedback, we have worked on improving the experience of using `odo` with Podman.
Note that this is still experimental and requires you to opt in if you want to try it out.

- In [#6329](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6329), we have added labels to resources created by `odo` on Podman, so we can easily identify and use them. This adds the same labels depicted in [How odo works](../docs/development/architecture/how-odo-works#resource-labels).
- With [#6366](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6366), `odo list component` is now able to list components running on Podman.
- With [#6328](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6328), `odo dev` now supports [volumes and volume mounts](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-volume-component) defined in a Devfile. [Volume components](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-volume-component) allow sharing files among container components.
- With [#6348](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6335), `odo dev` is now able to react to changes in local source files by re-synchronizing changed files and restarting the application running on Podman.
- With [#6377](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6377), `odo dev` no longer hard-codes the exposed host port. Instead, it is able to pick any freely available local port, in a range starting from `40001`.

See the demo below for an overview of these changes:

#### Support for multi-document YAML resource for Devfile Kubernetes components

`odo` now supports running Devfile components that are represented by a multi-document YAML.

#### Automatic application port detection

When running [`odo init` interactively](../docs/command-reference/init#interactive-mode), we now try to automatically detect as much as possible the ports used in the current application source code.
When information about the ports is available, we customize the initial Devfile accordingly.

#### Listing Devfile Stack versions

[`odo registry`](../docs/command-reference/registry) (and its [JSON counterpart](../docs/command-reference/json-output#odo-registry--o-json)) now displays the Devfile stack versions.
