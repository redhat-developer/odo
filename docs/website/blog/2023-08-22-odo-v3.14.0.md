odo `v3.14.0` is now out!

<!--truncate-->

To install `odo`, follow [the installation guide](/docs/overview/installation).

## Notable Changes

### Features

#### `odo dev` Web UI out of the experimental mode

The `odo` web User Interface, which was previously available experimentally, is now out of the experimental mode.
This means that it will be exposed and available out of the box whenever a Dev Session is started with `odo dev`, regardless of the experimental mode status.

This web UI currently aims at providing a simplified way to:
1. understand the Devfile and how `odo` interprets it.
2. edit the Devfile and tailor it to your project needs.

It is still a work in progress; so we are looking for feedback to improve it.

To use it, just start `odo dev` (regardless of the target platform) and navigate to the URL displayed in the output (or retrievable via the [`odo describe component`](/docs/command-reference/describe-component) command).

#### Support for Volumes in the `odo` Web UI

It is now possible to create Volumes in the `odo` Web UI and also to specify volume mounts from the Containers tab:

#### `--filter` in `odo registry` now supports a list of terms

When running `odo registry --filter`, you can  now pass a list of terms to filter the results.
`--filter` is now a comma-separated list of terms for filtering, and search is done using a logical AND against the name or description or supported architectures of the Devfile Stacks.

<details>

<summary>Example Output</summary>

```
$ odo registry --filter s390x,java

#### Filtering devfile stacks based on the architecture field in metadata when running `odo init`

When running `odo init` either interactively or non-interactively, the supported architectures declared in the Devfile are now handled.

In the interactive mode, `odo init` now allows you to pick the architectures you want or displays it from the Devfile suggested for your project.

<details>
<summary>Example Output</summary>

```text
$ odo init
[...]
Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
 ✓  Determining a Devfile for the current directory [603ms]
 ⚠  Could not determine a Devfile based on the files in the current directory: No valid devfile found for project in /tmp/test2
# highlight-start
? Select architectures to filter by:  [Use arrows to move, space to select, <right> to all, <left> to none, type to filter]
> [x]  amd64
  [ ]  arm64
  [ ]  ppc64le
  [ ]  s390x
# highlight-end
[...]
```
</details>

In the non-interactive mode, `odo init` allows you to specify the architectures using a repeatable `--architecture` option.

<details>
<summary>Example Output</summary>

```
$ odo init --name my-app --devfile nodejs \
    --architecture amd64 \
    --architecture s390x 

[...]

Your new component 'my-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
