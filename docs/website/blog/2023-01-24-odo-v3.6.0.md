## Notable Changes
Check this Playlist for an overview of the most notable changes in this release: [odo v3.6.0 (Sprint 230)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOrs_t1STsiE9iy_pw1iky0X)

### Features

#### Extend pod and container specification with Devfile attributes `pod-overrides` and `container-overrides`
It is now possible to extend a pod and its container specification by using `pod-overrides` and `container-overrides` Devfile attributes.

This feature allows you to modify pod specifications such as Service Account, Scheduler Name, Security Context, etc and container specifications such as Security Context, and Resources. However, it restricts from modifying pod specifications such as Init Containers, Containers, and Volumes; and container specifications such as Volume Mounts, Image, Ports, Name, Env, Args, and Commands.

`pod-overrides` and `container-overrides` can be specified at both Component and Devfile level. If an attribute is defined at both the levels, a strategic merge patch will be used to merge them both.

[//]: #: (TODO: Add reference to devfile once https://github.com/devfile/devfile-web/pull/70 is merged.)
Example -
```yaml
attributes:
  pod-overrides:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: my-new-service-account
  container-overrides:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1001
        runAsGroup: 1001
```

#### `odo delete component` now has a new `--running-in` flag
`--running-in` flag can be used with `odo delete component` to specify the mode in which resources should be deleted. There are 2 modes to choose from "dev", and "deploy". By default, the commands deletes all the resources regardless of the mode.

To delete resources running in 'Dev' mode, i.e. resources created by `odo dev` use `--running-in=dev`.

To delete resources running in 'Deploy' mode, i.e. resources created by `odo deploy` use `--running-in=deploy`.

#### `odo` can now be used inside DevSpaces
Port forwarding done by `odo dev` now uses port numbers starting from 20001 instead of 40001. This change was made to make it possible to run odo inside [DevSpaces](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview).

:::caution
This is a possible breaking change. For more information or any questions, see the issue [#6483](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6483).

#### `odo describe component` displays remote source code location for every containers
`odo describe component` now shows where the source code is located on your container. It uses the devfile container spec `mountSources` and `sourceMapping` to determine the location of a mounted source code.

#### `odo dev` on podman now logs errors when the command fails to run
`odo dev` when running on podman now logs error when the command fails to run. In the previous versions of `odo` this was possible with cluster only.
