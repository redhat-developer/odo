In this tutorial, I will show you how you can leverage `odo` to develop a .NET application communicating with the PostgreSQL database on OpenShift.
<!--truncate-->


## Prerequisites

- [odo](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation) [3.6.0](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/releases/tag/v3.6.0) or later
- [`oc` (OpenShift Client)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) (Optional, but recommended. Alternatively, you can use OpenShift Web Console to create PostgreSQL instance)
- Access to OpenShift cluster

:::tip
If you don't have access to the OpenShift cluster, you can use [OpenShift Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) to get access to the OpenShift cluster for FREE.

This is what I used for this tutorial.
:::

- Log in to the cluster using `odo`
  - Log in to the OpenShift Web Console, click on your username in the top right corner and select "Copy login command" ![Copy login command](/img/blog/odo-dotnet-postgresql-openshift/odc_copy_login_command.png)
  - You might get prompted to log in again. After that, you should be able to display the token.
  - Copy `oc login --token=.....` command that you see to your terminal, replace `oc` with `odo`, and execute the command. (If you have `oc` installed, you can leave the command as it is. `odo` and `oc` store the login information at the same place)


## Getting the application source code

We will use [.NET Core Sample App for OpenShift](https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex)

1. Clone the repository

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>example output</summary>
    <div>

    ```
    ▶ git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex
    Cloning into 's2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 87, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (28/28), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (16/16), done.

    Resolving deltas: 100% (44/44), done.
    ```
    </div>
  </details>

1. Change the directory with the application source code

  ```shell
  cd s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex/app
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>example output</summary>
    <div>

    ```
    ▶ cd s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex/app

    ▶ ls
    Data  Migrations  Pages  Program.cs  RazorPagesContacts.csproj  Startup.cs
    ```

    </div>
  </details>


1. Switch to the dotnet-6.0 branch

  ```shell
  git checkout dotnet-6.0
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>example output</summary>
    <div>

    ```
    ▶ git checkout dotnet-6.0
    branch 'dotnet-6.0' set up to track 'origin/dotnet-6.0'.
    Switched to a new branch 'dotnet-6.0'
    ```

    </div>
  </details>

  :::caution
  For now, we have to use .NET 6.0 as there is no Devfile stack .NET 7.0 in the official [Devfile registry](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer) yet.
  :::

## Use odo to develop a .NET application on the OpenShift cluster

In this part, we will start our .NET application inside the container on the OpenShift cluster.
Because the app will be built and run inside the container, we don't need to install any .NET tools on our local system. All we need is the `odo` CLI and an OpenShift cluster.

### Get the Devfile stack for .NET 6.0

:::info
The **Devfile stack** is a definition of the containerized development environment.
It defines the container image, the environment variables, and the commands that need to be executed to build, run, and optionally also test, debug and deploy the application.

You can learn more about Devfiles at [devfile.io](https://devfile.io/).
:::

#### Run `odo init` command
```sh
odo init
```

<details>
  <summary>example output</summary>
  <div>

  ```
    ▶ odo init
      __
    /  \__     Initializing a new component
    \__/  \    Files: Source code detected, a Devfile will be determined based upon source code autodetection
    /  \__/    odo version: v3.5.0
    \__/

    Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
    Based on the files in the current directory odo detected
    Language: .NET
    Project type: dotnet
    The devfile "dotnet50:1.0.3" from the registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" will be downloaded.
    ? Is this correct? No
    ? Select language: .NET
    ? Select project type: .NET 6.0
    ✓  Downloading devfile "dotnet60" from registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" [1s]

    ↪ Container Configuration "dotnet":
      OPEN PORTS:
        - 8080
      ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
        - CONFIGURATION = Debug
        - STARTUP_PROJECT = app.csproj
        - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = Development
        - ASPNETCORE_URLS = http://*:8080

    ? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
    ? Enter component name: myapp

    You can automate this command by executing:
      odo init --name myapp --devfile dotnet60 --devfile-registry DefaultDevfileRegistry

    Your new component 'myapp' is ready in the current directory.
    To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
    Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
  ```

  </div>
</details>



`odo init` command will guide you through selecting the correct Devfile stack and some basic configuration. For purposes of this tutorial, you can just accept the default values.


:::caution
Please pay attention to the version o the `dotnet` Devfile that odo suggests.
`odo` might not be able to detect the .NET version that our application is using correctly.
If that happens, you need to tell odo that it is not correct and select the correct version manually.
:::

#### Edit devfile

We need to modify `devfile.yaml` that got downloaded by `odo init` command to ensure that our application starts correctly.
The default .NET Devfile in the registry assumes that we have `app.csproj`, but our application uses `RazorPagesContacts.csproj`.

Open `devfile.yaml` that is in your project directory in your text editor or IDE.
Find lines that define the `STARTUP_PROJECT` environment variable.

  ```yaml
  - name: STARTUP_PROJECT
    value: app.csproj
  ```

Replace the `app.csproj` value with `RazorPagesContacts.csproj`

  ```yaml
  - name: STARTUP_PROJECT
    value: RazorPagesContacts.csproj
  ```

<details>
  <summary>Complete devfile.yaml after the changes.</summary>

### Start the application on the cluster

We have our application source code and the `devfile.yaml` that describes the environment in which the application should be executed. We can now start the application on the cluster. Just run `odo dev` in the project directory.


```sh
odo dev
```

<details>
  <summary>example output</summary>
  <div>

  ```
  ▶ odo dev
    __

  ```

  </div>
</details>

`odo dev` uses information from `devfile.yaml` to start the containers on the cluster. Than it copies all the source code from our local machine to the container and executes the `build` and `run` commands as defined in the `devfile.yaml`.

When the application is successfully running in the container `odo` also sets the port forwarding between your local machine and the container to ensure we can easily access our application on the local port.
In this case, it is `40001`. You can access the application on [http://localhost:40001](http://localhost:40001).

![App running with In Memory DB](/img/blog/odo-dotnet-postgresql-openshift/app_running_inmemory_db.png)

You can see that our application is now using the in-memory database. We will start the PostgreSQL database and connect our application in the following steps.

You can leave `odo dev` running in the terminal and open a new terminal window to continue with the next steps. Make sure that you run all `odo` commands in the the root folder  of our .NET application (where you have `devfile.yaml` and `RazorPagesContacts` files).

## Use the PostgreSQL database

### Start a new PostgreSQL instance on the OpenShift cluster

To start a new PostgreSQL instance on the OpenShift cluster, we can use the `postgresql-ephemeral` template that is available in the OpenShift cluster.

If you have `oc` CLI installed, you can use the following command to start a new PostgreSQL instance:

```sh
oc new-app postgresql-ephemeral
````
<details>
  <summary>example output</summary>
  <div>

  ```
  ▶ oc new-app postgresql-ephemeral
  --> Deploying template "openshift/postgresql-ephemeral" to project tkral-dev

      PostgreSQL (Ephemeral)

  ```

  </div>
</details>

If you don't have `oc` CLI installed, you can use the OpenShift web console to start a new PostgreSQL instance.

    </li>
  </ol>
  </div>
</details>
Now you have a new PostgreSQL instance running on the OpenShift cluster and we can connect our application to it.

### Connect the application to the PostgreSQL

We must ensure that our .NET application can connect to the PostgreSQL instance.
The application already expects the connection information to be available as environment variables.
We will use the `postgresql` Secret that was created by the `postgresql-ephemeral` template.

We will use one of the newest `odo` and Devfile features - `container-overrides`.
Using this feature, we can modify the container that the Devfile creates.

Open `devfile.yaml` in the application directory and add the following section to the `dotnet` container:

```yaml
attributes:
  container-overrides: {secretRef: {name: "postgresql"} }
```

While you have `devfile.yaml` open, you also need to add a new environment variable called `database-service`. This variable will tell our application to use the PostgreSQL database instead of the in-memory database.
Add the following lines in to the `env` section of the `dotnet` container:

```yaml
- name: database-service
  value: postgresql
```

<details>
  <summary>This is how the devfile.yaml should look like.</summary>
  <div>

  ```yaml
  commands:
  - exec:
      commandLine: kill $(pidof dotnet); dotnet build -c $CONFIGURATION $STARTUP_PROJECT
        /p:UseSharedCompilation=false
      component: dotnet
      group:

  ```
  </div>
</details>

As you modify the `devfile.yaml``, you can check the terminal window where you have `odo dev` running. You should see that `odo` is automatically handling the changes and reloading the application.



Now, refresh the local URL [http://localhost:40001](http://localhost:40001). You should see that our application is using the PostgreSQL database.
