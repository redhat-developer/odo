### Features

#### `odo describe component` displaying information about the running API Server

The command `odo describe component` now displays the information to access the API server started by `odo dev`. When this command is executed in Experimental mode, it also displays the information to access the odo graphical user interface.

#### `odo dev --logs` displaying logs during a Dev session

Previously it was necessary to execute an `odo logs` command in parallel to a Dev session started with `odo dev`, to be able to get the logs of the running component.

You can now ask with `odo dev --logs` to display the logs of the component in the output of the `odo dev` command.

#### API documentation

The documentation of the odo API served during a Dev session is accessible from the Dev session itself.

#### odo Graphical User Interface

The PoC available at https://devfile.odo.dev has been integrated into odo. When running `odo dev` in experimental mode, you can access this inteface to view and edit the Devfile used for the Dev session.
