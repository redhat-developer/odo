### Features

#### odo dev and odo deploy now always work on current Kubernetes namespace ([#6025](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6025))

`odo dev` and `odo deploy` are now always working on the current Kubernetes namespace, and are no longer saving the namespace on which they are working in a local file.

#### odo list: show the component manager version ([#6028](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6028))

`odo list` now outputs the version of the manager used to deploy a component, as described in the `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by-version` label of the component's deployment.

#### odo list displaying components and bindings ([#6043](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6043))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWxb_GXLW_w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

`odo list` combines the output of `odo list component` and `odo list binding`, for human-readable and JSON output.

#### odo no longer requires the optional 'metadata.name' field in Devfile ([#6015](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/6015))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20QOOAwil8M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If the `metadata.name` field is present in the Devfile, it is used as name of the deployed component. If not present, odo tries to detect the name automatically based on the project configuration. If this is not possible, the directory name is used instead.

#### odo using alizer name detection with odo init ([#5989](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pull/5989))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5pNWLSjhk8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

`odo init` detects the project name via pom.xml (java), package.json (node.js), etc using alizer. If the detection fails, defaults to using the directory name.
