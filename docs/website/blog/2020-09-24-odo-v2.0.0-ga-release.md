`2.0.0` of odo has been released!
<!--truncate-->

### What's new

#### Changes to the default deployment method

[Devfile](https://devfile.github.io/) is a file format that is used as odo's new deployment engine. Starting from `2.0.0` onwards, Source-to-Image (S2I) is no longer the default deployment method. S2I is still supported and can now be accessed with the `--s2i` flag from the command-line.

Learn how to deploy your first devfile using devfiles from our [Devfile tutorial](../docs/getting-started/quickstart).

Example on how to download a starter project and deploy a devfile:

```sh
$ odo create nodejs --starter
Validation
 ✓  Checking devfile existence [22411ns]
 ✓  Checking devfile compatibility [22492ns]
 ✓  Creating a devfile component from registry: DefaultDevfileRegistry [24341ns]
 ✓  Validating devfile component [74471ns]

Starter Project
 ✓  Downloading starter project nodejs-starter from https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex.git [479ms]

Please use `odo push` command to create the component with source deployed

$ odo push

Validation
 ✓  Validating the devfile [132092ns]

Creating Kubernetes resources for component nodejs
 ✓  Waiting for component to start [5s]

Applying URL changes
 ✓  URL http-3000: http://http-3000-nodejs-foobar.myproject.example.com/ created

Syncing to component nodejs
 ✓  Checking files for pushing [1ms]
 ✓  Syncing files to the component [868ms]

Executing devfile commands for component nodejs
 ✓  Executing install command "npm install" [4s]
 ✓  Executing run command "npm start" [2s]

Pushing devfile component nodejs
 ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component
```

#### Deploying a custom Kubernetes controller with odo

With the release of `2.0.0` deploying operators is now out of experimental mode.

Learn how to deploy your first Kubernetes custom controller from our [installation guide](../docs/getting-started/cluster-setup/kubernetes).

Example on how to deploy your first Operator:

```sh
$ odo catalog list services
  Operators available in the cluster
  NAME                          CRDs
  etcdoperator.v0.9.4           EtcdCluster, EtcdBackup, EtcdRestore

$ odo service create etcdoperator.v0.9.4/EtcdCluster
```

#### `odo debug` is no longer in technical preview

The `odo debug` command is no longer in technical preview.
