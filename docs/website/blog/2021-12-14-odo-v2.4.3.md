<!--truncate-->

## Notable changes in odo 2.4.3

### Features/Enhancements:

#### `odo deploy` command [#5228](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5228) ([@feloy](https://github.com/feloy))
In Devfile specificion v2.2.0 new component `image` and command group `deploy` were introduced.
`odo deploy` command uses those features to allow users deploying their application as it would be deployed in production. To build container images `odo deploy` requires Podman or Docker to be installed on your machine.

You can find example of how to use `image` component and `deploy` command group in devfile.yaml in [devfile-nodejs-deploy](https://github.com/kadel/devfile-nodejs-deploy) repository

#### Demo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kadel/devfile-nodejs-deploy
$ cd devfile-nodejs-deploy
$ odo project create nodejs-example
$ odo create
$ odo deploy
```
