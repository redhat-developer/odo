# Quickstart Guide

In this guide, we will be using odo to create a "Hello World" application with Node.js

## Prerequisites

* Have the odo binary [installed](../overview/installation.md).
* A [Kubernetes](../overview/cluster-setup/kubernetes) or [OpenShift cluster](../overview/cluster-setup/openshift) 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Step 0. Creating the initial source code (optional)

We will create the example source code by using some popular frameworks.

This is *optional* and you may use an existing project instead or a starter project from `odo init`.

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

For Node.JS we will use the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework for our example.

1. Install Express:
```console
$ npm install express --save
```

2. Generate an example project:
```console
$ npx express-generator

  warning: the default view engine will not be jade in future releases
  warning: use `--view=jade' or `--help' for additional options


   create : public/
   create : public/javascripts/
   create : public/images/
   create : public/stylesheets/
   create : public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : routes/
   create : routes/index.js
   create : routes/users.js
   create : views/
   create : views/error.jade
   create : views/index.jade
   create : views/layout.jade
   create : app.js
   create : package.json
   create : bin/
   create : bin/www

   install dependencies:
     $ npm install

   run the app:
     $ DEBUG=express:* npm start
```

Your source code has now been generated and created in the directory.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 1. Creating your application (`odo init`)

Now we'll initialize your application by creating a `devfile.yaml` to be deployed.

`odo` handles this automatically with the `odo init` command by autodetecting your source code and downloading the appropriate Devfile.

**Note:** If you skipped *Step 0*, select a "starter project" when running `odo init`.

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

Let's run `odo init` and select Node.js:

```console
$ odo init
  __
 /  \__     Initializing new component
 \__/  \    Files: Source code detected, a Devfile will be determined based upon source code autodetection
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0-alpha1
 \__/

Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
Based on the files in the current directory odo detected
Language: javascript
Project type: nodejs
The devfile "nodejs" from the registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" will be downloaded.
? Is this correct? Yes
 ✓  Downloading devfile "nodejs" from registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" [501ms]
Current component configuration:
Container "runtime":
  Opened ports:
   - 3000
  Environment variables:
? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
? Enter component name: my-nodejs-app

Your new component 'my-nodejs-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
```

A `devfile.yaml` has now been added to your directory and now you're ready to start development.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2. Developing your application continuously (`odo dev`)

Now that we've generated our code as well as our Devfile, let's start on development.

`odo` uses inner loop development and allows you to code, build, run and test the application in a continuous workflow.

Once you run `odo dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `odo` rebuilds and redeploys it.

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

Let's run `odo dev` to start development on your Node.JS application:
```console
$ odo dev
  __
 /  \__     Developing using the my-nodejs-app Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: default
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0-alpha1
 \__/

↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 ✓  Waiting for Kubernetes resources [3s]
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [330ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster [4s]
 ✓  Executing the application [1s]

Your application is now running on the cluster
 - Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 3000

Watching for changes in the current directory /Users/user/syncthing/dev/k8s/devfiles/express
Press Ctrl+c to exit `odo dev` and delete resources from the cluster
```

You can now access the application at [127.0.0.1:40001](http://127.0.0.1:40001) in your local browser and start your development loop. `odo` will watch for changes and push the code for real-time updates.

</Tabs>

## Step 3. Deploying your application to the world (`odo deploy`)

**Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, you must login to a container registry that we will be pushing our application to.

Login to your container registry with either `podman` or `docker`:

```console
$ podman login
# or
$ docker login
```

**NOTE:** If you are running Apple Silicon (M1), you must set your Docker build platform to the cluster you are deploying to.

For example, if you are deploying to `linux/amd64`:

```console
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64  
```

**Overview:**

There are three steps to deploy your application:

1. Containerize your application by creating a `Dockerfile`
2. Modify `devfile.yaml` to add your Kubernetes code
3. Run `odo deploy`

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

#### 1. Containerize the application

In order to deploy our application, we must containerize it in order to build and push to a registry. Create the following `Dockerfile` in the same directory:

```dockerfile
# Sample copied from https://github.com/nodeshift-starters/devfile-sample/blob/main/Dockerfile

# Install the app dependencies in a full Node docker image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14:latest

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the dependencies into a Slim Node docker image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14-minimal:latest

# Install app dependencies
COPY --from=0 /opt/app-root/src/node_modules /opt/app-root/src/node_modules
COPY . /opt/app-root/src

ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### 2. Modify the Devfile

Let's modify the `devfile.yaml` and add the respective deployment code.

`odo deploy` uses Devfile schema **2.2.0**. Change the schema to reflect the change:

```yaml
# Deploy "kind" ID's use schema 2.2.0+
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
```

Add the `variables` section:

```yaml
# Add the following variables code anywhere in devfile.yaml
# This MUST be a container registry you are able to access
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: quay.io/MYUSERNAME/nodejs-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-nodejs-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "3000"
  DOMAIN_NAME: nodejs.example.com
```

Add the commands used to deploy:

```yaml
# This is the main "composite" command that will run all below commands
- id: deploy
  composite:
    commands:
    - build-image
    - k8s-deployment
    - k8s-service
    - k8s-ingress
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: deploy

# Below are the commands and their respective components that they are "linked" to deploy
- id: build-image
  apply:
    component: outerloop-build
- id: k8s-deployment
  apply:
    component: outerloop-deployment
- id: k8s-service
  apply:
    component: outerloop-service
- id: k8s-ingress
  apply:
    component: outerloop-ingress
```

Add the Kubernetes Service and Ingress inline code to `components`:
```yaml
components:

# This will build the container image before deployment
- name: outerloop-build
  image:
    dockerfile:
      buildContext: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      rootRequired: false
      uri: ./Dockerfile
    imageName: "{{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}"

# This will create a Deployment in order to run your container image across
# the cluster.
- name: outerloop-deployment
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: nodejs
                image: {{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}
                ports:
                  - name: http
                    containerPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
                    protocol: TCP
                resources:
                  limits:
                    memory: "1024Mi"
                    cpu: "500m"

# This will create a Service so your Deployment is accessible.
# Depending on your cluster, you may modify this code so it's a
# NodePort, ClusterIP or a LoadBalancer service.
- name: outerloop-service
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        ports:
        - name: "{{CONTAINER_PORT}}"
          port: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
        selector:
          app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
        type: ClusterIP

# Let's create an Ingress so we can access the application via a domain name
- name: outerloop-ingress
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: Ingress
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        rules:
          - host: "{{DOMAIN_NAME}}"
            http:
              paths:
                - path: "/"
                  pathType: Prefix
                  backend:
                    service:
                      name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}} 
                      port:
                        number: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
```


#### 3. Run the `odo deploy` command

Now we're ready to run `odo deploy`:

```console
$ odo deploy
  __
