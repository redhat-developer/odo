# Features of odo

By using `odo`, application developers can develop, test, debug, and deploy microservices based applications on Kubernetes without having a deep understanding of the platform.


- Thanks to a library of [predefined Devfile stacks](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer) you don't have to worry about setting up your build pipelines.
- `odo` allows you easily develop application while it is running on Kubernetes cluster. 


Take a look at the "Using odo" documentation for in-depth guides on doing advanced commands with `odo`.

## What features to expect in odo?

For a quick high level summary of the features we are planning to add, take a look at odo's [milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/milestones).
