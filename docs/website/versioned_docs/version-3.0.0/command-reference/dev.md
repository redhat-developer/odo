## Description

`odo dev` is used in order to quickly and effectively iterate through your development process for building an application.

This is [inner loop](../intro#what-is-inner-loop-and-outer-loop) development and allows you to code, build, run and test the application in a continuous workflow.

## Running the Command

If you haven't already done so, you must [initialize](../command-reference/init) your source code with the `odo init` command.

Afterwards, run `odo dev`:

```sh
$ odo dev
  __
 /  \__     Developing using the my-nodejs-app Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: default
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0-alpha1
 \__/

↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 ✓  Waiting for Kubernetes resources [3s]
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [335ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster [2s]
 ✓  Executing the application [1s]

Your application is now running on the cluster
 - Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 3000

Watching for changes in the current directory /Users/user/nodejs
Press Ctrl+c to exit `odo dev` and delete resources from the cluster
```

In the above example, three things have happened:
  * Your application has been built and deployed to the cluster
  * `odo` has port-forwarded your application for local accessability
  * `odo` will watch for changes in the current directory and rebuild the application when changes are detected

## Devfile (Advanced Usage)


### Description

When `odo dev` is ran, it first looks in the `devfile.yaml` for the instructions to be executed, specifically: `components` and `commands`.

Each command has a group `kind` key which correspond to either: `build`, `run`, `test`, or `debug`.

These instructions make up the development cycle of `odo dev`.

### Snippets

With the following example `devfile.yaml` file generated by `odo init` and selecting `nodejs`, a container image will be pushed to the cluster, as well as your source code in order to start the development inner loop cycle.

A much more descriptive explanation on each part of a Devfile can be found on the [Devfile API reference](https://devfile.io/docs/devfile/2.0.0/user-guide/api-reference/) site.

Below, we'll explain each section of the corresponding Devfile:

#### `metadata`

> Descriptive registry information with regards to the devfile being used.
```yaml
metadata:
  description: Stack with Node.js 14
  displayName: Node.js Runtime
  icon: https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs-new-pantone-black.svg
  language: javascript
  name: my-nodejs-app
  projectType: nodejs
  tags:
  - NodeJS
  - Express
  - ubi8
  version: 1.0.1
schemaVersion: 2.0.0
```

#### `starterProjects`
> The starter projects available for this devfile, shown when running `odo init`.
```yaml
starterProjects:
- git:
    remotes:
      origin: https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex.git
  name: nodejs-starter
```

#### `commands`

> The list of commands to be used when running `odo dev`.
>
> Each command contains what will be ran within the container.
>
> The four groups are: build, run, test and debug.
>
> Build is what is initially ran when deploying to the cluster. It is what builds the initial container.
>
> Run executes the command after the container has been built. 
>
> Debug is enabled when running `odo dev --debug`.
>
> Test executes any tests which are available and part of your application. (This is NOT-YET-IMPLEMENTED in odo)
>
> All of these commands are needed to: build the program, execute the code, debug the application and run any applicable tests.
```yaml
commands:
- exec:
    commandLine: npm install
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: build
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: install
- exec:
    commandLine: npm start
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: run
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: run
- exec:
    commandLine: npm run debug
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: debug
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: debug
- exec:
    commandLine: npm test
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: test
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: test
```

#### `components`

> Components can include containers as well as Kubernetes yaml.
>
> In our example, the nodejs image is being used on port 3000.
```yaml
components:
- name: runtime
  container:
    endpoints:
    - name: http-3000
      targetPort: 3000
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14:latest
    memoryLimit: 1024Mi
    mountSources: true
```
