title: odo logs
---

## Description

`odo logs` is used to display the logs for all the containers odo created for the component under current working 
directory.

## Running the command 

If you haven't already done so, you must [initialize](../command-reference/init) your source code with the `odo 
init` command. Next, run the `odo dev` command so that odo can create the resources on the Kubernetes cluster.

Consider a devfile.yaml like below which was used to create inner loop resources using `odo dev`. Notice that 
multiple containers have been named as `main` to show how `odo logs` would display logs when more than one 
containers have the same name:

When you do `odo dev`, odo creates pods for:
1. The component named `node` itself. Containers for this are created using `.components.container`.
2. Kubernetes component named `infinitepodone`
3. Kubernetes component named `infinitedeployment`. As can be seen under `.spec.template.spec.containers` for this 
   particular component, it creates one container for it.

When you run `odo logs`, you should see logs from all these containers. Each line is prefixed with 
`<container-name>:` to easily distinguish which the container the logs belong to. Since we named multiple 
containers in the `devfile.yaml` as `main`, `odo logs` has distinguished these containers as `main` and `main[1]`:
```shell
