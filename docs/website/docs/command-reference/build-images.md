title: odo build-images
---

`odo` can build container images based on Dockerfiles, and push these images to their registries.

When running the command `odo build-images`, `odo` searches for all components in the `devfile.yaml` with the `image` type, for example:

```
components:
- image:
    imageName: quay.io/myusername/myimage
    dockerfile:
      uri: ./Dockerfile
      buildContext: ${PROJECTS_ROOT}
  name: component-built-from-dockerfile
```

The `uri` field indicates the relative path of the Dockerfile to use, relative to the directory containing the `devfile.yaml`. 
As indicated in the Devfile specification, `uri` could also be an HTTP or HTTPS URL.

The `buildContext` indicates the directory used as build context. The default value is `${PROJECT_SOURCE}`.

For each image component, `odo` executes either `podman` or `docker` (the first one found, in this order), to build the image with the specified Dockerfile, build context and arguments.

If the `--push` flag is passed to the command, the images will be pushed to their registries after they are built.

## Running the command
### Pre-requisites
* Login to an image registry(quay.io, hub.docker.com, etc)
* Dockerfile

```shell
odo build-images
```

### Faking the image build
You can also fake the image build by exporting `PODMAN_CMD=echo` or `DOCKER_CMD=echo` to your environment. Read [environment variables controlling `odo` behaviour](../overview/configure.md#environment-variables-controlling-odo-behavior) for more information.

## Substituting variables

The Devfile can define variables to make the Devfile parameterizable. The Devfile can define values for these variables, and you
can override the values for variables from the command line when running `odo build-images`, using the `--var` and `--var-file` options.

See [Substituting variables in `odo` dev](dev.md#substituting-variables) for more information.
