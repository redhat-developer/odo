title: odo deploy
---

`odo` can be used to deploy components in a similar manner they would be deployed by a CI/CD system, 
by first building the images of the containers to deploy, then by deploying the Kubernetes resources
necessary to deploy the components.

When running the command `odo deploy`, `odo` searches for the default command of kind `deploy` in the devfile, and executes this command.
The kind `deploy` is supported by the devfile format starting from version 2.2.0.

The `deploy` command is typically a *composite* command, composed of several *apply* and *exec* commands:
- an `apply` command referencing an `image` component that, when applied, will build the image of the container to deploy, and push it to its registry,
- an `apply` command referencing a [`kubernetes` component](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/defining-kubernetes-resources) that, when applied, will create a Kubernetes resource in the cluster.
- an `exec` command referencing a container component that, when applied, will run the command defined by `commandLine` inside a container started by a Kubernetes Job; read more about it [here](../development/devfile.md#how-odo-runs-exec-commands-in-deploy-mode).

- With the following example `devfile.yaml` file, a container image will be built by using the `Dockerfile` present in the directory,
the image will be pushed to its registry and a Kubernetes Deployment will be created in the cluster, using this freshly built image.

## Substituting variables

The Devfile can define variables to make the Devfile parameterizable. The Devfile can define values for these variables, and you 
can override the values for variables from the command line when running `odo deploy`, using the `--var` and `--var-file` options.

See [Substituting variables in `odo` dev](dev.md#substituting-variables) for more information.
