All of our developer and user discussions happen in the [#odo channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C01D6L2NUAG) on the Kubernetes Slack.

If you haven't already joined the Kubernetes Slack, you can [invite yourself here](https://slack.k8s.io/).

Ask questions, inquire about odo or even discuss a new feature.

### Email list

For general help and inquiries as well as developmental discussion, we use Google Groups as our email list.

* Documentation issues can be filed with the [documentation template](https://github.com/openshift/odo/issues/new?template=Documentation.md)

### Public meetings

Every two weeks, we have a contributors call meeting.

Every three weeks, we have two planning calls:

* "Sprint Planning Preparation and Issue Triage" - on Monday
* "Sprint Planning" - on Wednesday

You can find the exact dates of all scheduled odo calls together with sprint dates in the [odo calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gi0s0v5ukfqkjpnn26p6va3jfc%40group.calendar.google.com).

To automatically get invites to the calls, add yourself to the [odo-dev Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/odo-dev).
