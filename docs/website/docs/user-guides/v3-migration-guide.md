### Migrate an existing `odo` component from v2 to v3
If you have created an `odo` component using `odo` v2, this section will help you move it to use `odo` v3.
#### Step 1 
`cd` into the component directory, and delete the component from the Kubernetes cluster:
```shell
odo delete
```
#### Step 2
Download and [install odo v3](../overview/installation.md).

#### Step 3
Run [`odo dev`](../command-reference/dev.md) to start developing your application using `odo` v3.

#### Step 4
Run `odo list` to see a list of components that are running on the cluster and what version of `odo` they are running.

### Where are `odo push` and `odo watch` commands?
`odo push` and `odo watch` have been replaced in v3 by a single command - `odo dev`. 

In v2, if you wanted to automatically sync the code on developer system with the application running on a Kubernetes
cluster, you had to perform two steps - first `odo push` to start the application on the cluster, and second `odo watch`
to automatically sync the code. In v3, `odo dev` performs both actions with a single command.

`odo dev` is not _just_ a replacement for these two commands. It's also different in behaviour in that, it's a 
long-running process that's going to block the terminal. Hitting `Ctrl+c` will stop the process and cleanup the 
component from the cluster. In v2, you had to use `odo delete`/`odo component delete` to delete inner loop resources 
of the component from the cluster.

### What happened to Ingress/Route?
If you have used `odo` v2, you must have used Ingress (on Kubernetes) or Route (on OpenShift) to access the 
application that was pushed to the cluster using `odo push`. `odo` v3 no longer creates an Ingress or a Route. Instead,
it uses port-forwarding.

When running `odo dev`, `odo` forwards a port on the development system to the port on the container cluster allowing 
you remote access to your deployed application. It also prints the information when the application has started on the
cluster:
```shell
$ odo dev
...
...
-  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 8080
```
This indicates that the port 40001 on the development system has been forwarded to port 8080 of the application 
represented by the current `odo` component.

:::info NOTE
`odo` no longer supports creation of Ingress / Route out of the box. The `odo url` set of commands no longer exist 
in v3.
:::

### Changes to the way component debugging works
In `odo` v2, `odo push --debug` was used to run a component in debug mode. To setup port forwarding to the component's
debug port, you had to run `odo debug port-forward`.

In `odo` v3, you need to specify the debug port in the `devfile.yaml` as an endpoint, and run `odo dev --debug` to 
start the component in debug mode. For example, a `container` component in the devfile should look like below, where 
port 3000 is the application port and 5858 is the debug port:

```yaml
- name: runtime
  container:
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-12:1-36
    memoryLimit: 1024Mi
    endpoints:
    - name: "3000-tcp"
      targetPort: 3000
    - name: debug
      exposure: none
      targetPort: 5858
```
### Changes to default configurations

#### Ephemeral storage

By default, `odo` v2 used [ephemeral storage](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/storage/understanding-ephemeral-storage.html) 
for the components created using it. However, this has changed in `odo` v3, and it now uses the underlying storage 
(Persistent Volumes) configured for use by the users. If you would like to continue using ephemeral storage for `odo` 
components, you could change the configuration by doing:
```shell
odo preference set Ephemeral true
```

### Commands added, modified or removed in v3

The following table contains a list of `odo` commands that have either been modified or removed. In case of a 
modification, the modified command is mentioned in the `v3` column. Please refer below legend beforehand:
