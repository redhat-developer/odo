<CreatingApp name="nodejs" port="3000" language="javascript" framework="Node.JS"/>

Now that we've generated our code as well as our Devfile, let's start on development.

`odo` uses [inner loop development](/docs/introduction#what-is-inner-loop-and-outer-loop) and allows you to code, 
build, run and test the application in a continuous workflow.

Once you run `odo dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `odo` rebuilds and redeploys it.

<p>Let's run <code>odo dev</code> to start development on your <span>{props.framework}</span> application:</p>

```console
odo dev
```

<div>
<CodeBlock language="console">
{`\
$ odo dev
  __
 /  \\__     Developing using the my-`}{props.name}{`-app Devfile
 \\__/  \\    Namespace: default`}<Version/>{`
↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 ✓  Waiting for Kubernetes resources [3s]
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [330ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster [4s]
 ✓  Executing the application [1s]
\n
Your application is now running on the cluster
 - Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> `}{props.port}{`
\n
Watching for changes in the current directory /Users/user/`}{props.name}{`
Press Ctrl+c to exit \`odo dev\` and delete resources from the cluster
`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

You can now access the application at [127.0.0.1:40001](http://127.0.0.1:40001) in your local browser and start your development loop. `odo` will watch for changes and push the code for real-time updates.
