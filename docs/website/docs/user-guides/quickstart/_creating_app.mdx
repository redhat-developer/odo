Now we'll initialize your application by creating a `devfile.yaml` to be deployed.

`odo` handles this automatically with the `odo init` command by autodetecting your source code and downloading the appropriate Devfile.

**Note:** If you skipped *Step 0*, select a "starter project" when running `odo init`.

<p>Let's run <code>odo init</code> and select <span>{props.framework}</span>:</p>

```console
odo init
```

<div>
<CodeBlock language="console">
{`\
$ odo init

Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
Based on the files in the current directory odo detected
Language: `}{props.language}{`
Project type: `}{props.name}{`
Application ports: `}{props.port}{`
The devfile "`}{props.name}{`" from the registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" will be downloaded.
? Is this correct? Yes
 âœ“  Downloading devfile "`}{props.name}{`" from registry "DefaultDevfileRegistry" [501ms]
Current component configuration:
Container "runtime":
  Opened ports:
   - `}{props.port}{`
  Environment variables:
? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
? Enter component name: my-`}{props.name}{`-app
\n
Your new component 'my-`}{props.name}{`-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'odo dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.

</CodeBlock>
</div>

A `devfile.yaml` has now been added to your directory and now you're ready to start development.
