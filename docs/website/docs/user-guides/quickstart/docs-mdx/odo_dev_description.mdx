Now that we've generated our code as well as our Devfile, let's start on development.

`odo` uses [inner loop development](/docs/introduction#what-is-inner-loop-and-outer-loop) and allows you to code,
build, run and test the application in a continuous workflow.

Once you run `odo dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `odo` rebuilds and redeploys it.

<p>Let's run <code>odo dev</code> to start development on your <span>{props.framework}</span> application:</p>

```console
odo dev
```

Then wait a few seconds until `odo dev` displays `Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:...` in its output,
meaning that `odo` has successfully set up the port forwarding to reach the application running in the container.

    <summary>Sample Output</summary>
    {props.devout}
</details>

You can now access the application via the local port displayed by `odo dev` ([127.0.0.1:20001](http://127.0.0.1:20001) in the sample output above) and start your development loop. `odo` will watch for changes and push the code for real-time updates.
