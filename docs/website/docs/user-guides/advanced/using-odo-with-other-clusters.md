title: Troubleshoot Storage Permission issues on managed cloud providers clusters
sidebar_position: 9

Using `odo` to run an application on a managed [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service), or [Amazon Elatic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster does not always work out of the box, especially while using Devfiles from the [Devfile Registry](https://registry.devfile.io); users often encounter issues while syncing local files into the container due to insufficient permissions on mounted volumes.

<details>
<summary>For example, while running a Java Maven application using a <code>java-maven</code> devfile on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, a sample error may look like this.</summary>

</details>

Various factors are responsible for this:
* Storage Provisioner used for the cluster
* User set by the container image
* Location on the container where the files are to be synced
* Using Ephemeral vs Non-Ephemeral Volumes

Users may encounter storage related permissions issues even while working on a standard Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

This guide will discuss some workarounds that can be used to fix these issues.

### Use Ephemeral Volumes
This is the simplest way to overcome this issue. There are 2 parts to this solution:
1. Set `odo` preference `Ephemeral` to _true_.

   ```shell
    odo preference set Ephemeral true -f
    ```
2. If the Devfile contains a `volume` component, then set its `ephemeral` property to `true`.

   The above configuration will use the [`emptyDir` Ephemeral volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) instead of creating Persistent Volumes to mount the source files; it also ensures the current user can read/write to the directories.

### Set `fsGroup` to the PodSecurityContext
By setting `fsGroup` in the PodSecurityContext, all processes of the container are also made part of the supplementary group ID set in the field. The owner for volume mount location and any files created in that volume will be Group ID set in the field. This solution is quite common when looking for permission related issues on a mounted volume, [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50156124/kubernetes-nfs-persistent-volumes-permission-denied#50187723).

This solution can be implemented by setting a [`pod-overrides`](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/overriding-pod-and-container-attributes#pod-overrides) attribute to the Devfile `container` component.

:::info
Be cautious with the use of fsGroup; the changing of group ownership of an entire volume can cause pod startup delays for slow and/or large filesystems.
Read these articles by [Synk](https://snyk.io/blog/10-kubernetes-security-context-settings-you-should-understand/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-gke-storage#mounting_a_volume_stops_responding_due_to_the_fsgroup_setting) to learn more about it.
:::

Note that the above warning is only valid when mounting persistent volumes with large data (for e.g. a Postgres image mounting a 1Tb volume with its data); for a normal developer workflow this should not be a concern.

The ownership change will only take an effect when mounting the volume for the first time while creating a pod, or when a pod is restarted due to a change in the Devfile; but even in those cases; ownership change should be quick.

:::note
If you do not know the desired group ID, you can assign a random value to it. The user will be added to the group ID and since all the files on the system will be owned by this group, there should be no problem with accessing the files.
