# API Server

An `odo dev` session starts an API server, generally available on `http://localhost:20000/api/v1/`
(the port number can change depending on availability of ports), 
which can be used to get information from the Dev session and to send commands to the session.

The developer documentation of the API is available at `http://localhost:20000/swagger-ui/`
(the port can change and the `odo dev` command displays it when it starts).
