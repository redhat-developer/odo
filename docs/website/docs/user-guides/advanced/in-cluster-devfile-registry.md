Besides getting the list of Devfile Registries to work with from the [local configuration file](../../overview/configure.md#managing-devfile-registries),
`odo` can automatically detect Devfile Registries declared in the current cluster, and use them.

It does so by detecting the presence of the following [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in the current cluster:
- `ClusterDevfileRegistriesList`: installable at the cluster level
- `DevfileRegistriesList`: installable at the namespace level

More details on the [Devfile Registry Operator documentation](https://github.com/devfile/registry-operator/blob/main/REGISTRIES_LISTS.md).

:::info

Registries declared in `ClusterDevfileRegistriesList` and `DevfileRegistriesList` Custom Resources do not necessarily need to be deployed and running in the cluster.
Only their URLs are listed in those resources.

:::

Registries listed in the Custom Resources above are added automatically to the top of the list of registries usable by `odo`, and `odo` will use them in the following priority order:
1. registries from the current namespace (declared in the `DevfileRegistriesList` resource)
2. cluster-wide registries (declared in the `ClusterDevfileRegistriesList` resource) 
3. all other registries configured in the local configuration file

This behavior applies to all `odo` commands interacting with Devfile registries, such as:
- [`odo preference view`](../../command-reference/preference.md)
- [`odo registry`](../../command-reference/registry.md)
- [`odo analyze`](../../command-reference/json-output.md#odo-analyze--o-json)
- [`odo init`](../../command-reference/init.md)
- [`odo dev`](../../command-reference/dev.md) and [`odo deploy`](../../command-reference/deploy.md) when there is no Devfile in the current directory

You can use the `odo preference view` command at any time to see the registries sorted by priority.
