Let's modify the `devfile.yaml` and add the respective deployment code.

:::caution
When copy/pasting to `devfile.yaml`, make sure the lines you inserted are correctly indented.
:::

`odo deploy` uses Devfile schema **2.2.0**. Change the schema to reflect the change:

```yaml
# Deploy "kind" ID's use schema 2.2.0+
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
```

Add the `variables` and change them appropriately:

<div>
<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`
# Add the following variables code anywhere in devfile.yaml
# This MUST be a container registry you are able to access
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: quay.io/MYUSERNAME/`}{props.name}{`-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-`}{props.name}{`-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "`}{props.port}{`"
  DOMAIN_NAME: `}{props.name}{`.example.com
`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

Add the commands used to deploy:

```yaml
# This is the main "composite" command that will run all below commands
commands:
- id: deploy
  composite:
    commands:
    - build-image
    - k8s-deployment
    - k8s-service
    - k8s-url
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: deploy

# Below are the commands and their respective components that they are "linked" to deploy
- id: build-image
  apply:
    component: outerloop-build
- id: k8s-deployment
  apply:
    component: outerloop-deployment
- id: k8s-service
  apply:
    component: outerloop-service
- id: k8s-url
  apply:
    component: outerloop-url
```

Add the Docker image location as well as Kubernetes Deployment and Service resources to `components`:
```yaml
components:

# This will build the container image before deployment
- name: outerloop-build
  image:
    dockerfile:
      buildContext: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      rootRequired: false
      uri: ./Dockerfile
    imageName: "{{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}"

# This will create a Deployment in order to run your container image across
# the cluster.
- name: outerloop-deployment
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
                image: {{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}
                ports:
                  - name: http
                    containerPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
                    protocol: TCP
                resources:
                  limits:
                    memory: "1024Mi"
                    cpu: "500m"

# This will create a Service so your Deployment is accessible.
# Depending on your cluster, you may modify this code so it's a
# NodePort, ClusterIP or a LoadBalancer service.
- name: outerloop-service
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        ports:
        - name: "{{CONTAINER_PORT}}"
          port: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
        selector:
          app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
        type: NodePort
```

To be able to access our application we need to add one more `component` to the Devfile.
For OpenShift cluster we add Route. For Kubernetes cluster we add Ingress.
