import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Version from '../../../_version.mdx';

Now we're ready to run `odo deploy`:

```console
odo deploy
```

`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

Your application has now been deployed to the Kubernetes cluster with Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources.

:::note
Depending upon the container registry specified in the `devfile.yaml`, the access for container image
pushed by `odo deploy` may be private by default. For example: images pushed to [Quay.io](https://quay.io). Change the
image visibility appropriately to be able to run `odo deploy` successfully.
:::

Test your application by visiting the `DOMAIN_NAME` variable that you had set in the `devfile.yaml`.
