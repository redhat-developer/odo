# Quickstart Guide

In this guide, we will be using odo to create a "Hello World" application.

You have the option of choosing from the following frameworks for the quickstart guide:
* Node.js
* .NET
* Java (Spring Boot)
* Go

A full list of example applications can be viewed with the `odo registry` command.

## Prerequisites

* Have the odo binary [installed](../overview/installation.md).
* A [Kubernetes](../overview/cluster-setup/kubernetes) or [OpenShift cluster](../overview/cluster-setup/openshift) 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Step 0. Creating the initial source code (optional)

We will create the example source code by using some popular frameworks.

This is *optional* and you may use an existing project instead or a starter project from `odo init`.

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

For Node.JS we will use the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework for our example.

1. Install Express:
```console
$ npm install express --save
```

2. Generate an example project:
```console
$ npx express-generator

   create : public/javascripts/
   create : public/images/
   create : public/stylesheets/
   create : public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : routes/
   create : routes/index.js
   create : routes/users.js
   create : views/
   create : views/error.jade
   create : views/index.jade
   create : views/layout.jade
   create : app.js
   create : package.json
   create : bin/
   create : bin/www

   install dependencies:
     $ npm install

   run the app:
     $ DEBUG=express:* npm start
```


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

  For .NET we will use the [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code) example. 

  ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework that implements the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.

  1. Generate an example project:

```console
$ dotnet new mvc --name app

Welcome to .NET 6.0!

```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="java" label="Java (Spring Boot)">

For Java, we will use the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate the example source code:

1. Navigate to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) 
2. Select **11** under **Java**
3. Click on "Add" under "Dependencies"
4. Select "Spring Web"
5. Click "Generate" to generate and download the source code

Finally, open a terminal and navigate to the directory.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">

For Go, we will create our own application using the standard library:

1. Create the following `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", HelloServer)
  http.ListenAndServe("0.0.0.0:8080", nil)
}

func HelloServer(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}
```

2. Initialize a `go.mod` file:

```console
$ go mod init my.example.go.project
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your source code has now been generated and created in the directory.


## Step 1. Connect to your cluster and create a new namespace or project

Before starting you should make sure that odo is connected to your cluster and that you have created a new namespace (or project if you are using OpenShift).




<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

### Creating a new namespace

If you are using Kubernetes, you can create a new namespace with the `odo create namespace` command.

```console
$ odo create namespace odo-dev
 ✓  Namespace "odo-dev" is ready for use
 ✓  New namespace created and now using namespace: odo-dev
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="openshift" label="OpenShift">

### Login to OpenShift Cluster

The easiest way to connect `odo` to an OpenShift cluster is use copy "Copy login command" function in OpenShift Web Console.

1. Login to OpenShift Web Console.
2. At the top right corner click on your username and then on "Copy login command".
3. You will be prompted to enter your login credentials again.
4. After login, open "Display Token" link.
5. Copy whole `oc login --token ...` command and paste it into the terminal, **before executing the command replace `oc` with `odo`.**

### Create a new project

If you are using OpenShift, you can create a new namespace with the `odo create project` command.

```console
$ odo create project odo-dev
 ✓  Project "odo-dev" is ready for use
 ✓  New project created and now using namespace: odo-dev
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2. Creating your application (`odo init`)

Now we'll initialize your application by creating a `devfile.yaml` to be deployed.

`odo` handles this automatically with the `odo init` command by autodetecting your source code and downloading the appropriate Devfile.

**Note:** If you skipped *Step 0*, select a "starter project" when running `odo init`.

## Step 3. Developing your application continuously (`odo dev`)

Now that we've generated our code as well as our Devfile, let's start on development.

`odo` uses inner loop development and allows you to code, build, run and test the application in a continuous workflow.

Once you run `odo dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `odo` rebuilds and redeploys it.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can now access the application at [127.0.0.1:40001](http://127.0.0.1:40001) in your local browser and start your development loop. `odo` will watch for changes and push the code for real-time updates.


## Step 4. Deploying your application to the world (`odo deploy`)

**Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, you must login to a container registry that we will be pushing our application to.

Login to your container registry with either `podman` or `docker`:

```console
$ podman login
# or
$ docker login
```

In order for `odo deploy` to push your image, your container registry needs to be accessible.


**NOTE for MacOS:** If you are running Apple Silicon (M1/M2), you must set your Docker build platform to the cluster you are deploying to.

For example, if you are deploying to `linux/amd64`:

```console
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64  
```

**Overview:**

There are three steps to deploy your application:

1. Containerize your application by creating a `Dockerfile`
2. Modify `devfile.yaml` to add your Kubernetes code
3. Run `odo deploy`

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

#### 1. Containerize the application

In order to deploy our application, we must containerize it in order to build and push to a registry. Create the following `Dockerfile` in the same directory:

```dockerfile
# Sample copied from https://github.com/nodeshift-starters/devfile-sample/blob/main/Dockerfile

# Install the app dependencies in a full Node docker image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14:latest

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the dependencies into a Slim Node docker image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14-minimal:latest

# Install app dependencies
COPY --from=0 /opt/app-root/src/node_modules /opt/app-root/src/node_modules
COPY . /opt/app-root/src

ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### 2. Modify the Devfile

Let's modify the `devfile.yaml` and add the respective deployment code.

:::caution
When copy/pasting to `devfile.yaml`, make sure the lines you inserted are correctly indented.
:::

`odo deploy` uses Devfile schema **2.2.0**. Change the schema to reflect the change:

```yaml
# Deploy "kind" ID's use schema 2.2.0+
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
```

Add the `variables` section:

```yaml
# Add the following variables code anywhere in devfile.yaml
# This MUST be a container registry you are able to access
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: quay.io/MYUSERNAME/nodejs-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-nodejs-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "3000"
  DOMAIN_NAME: nodejs.example.com
```

Add the commands used to deploy:

```yaml
# This is the main "composite" command that will run all below commands
commands:
- id: deploy
  composite:
    commands:
    - build-image
    - k8s-deployment
    - k8s-service
    - k8s-url
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: deploy

# Below are the commands and their respective components that they are "linked" to deploy
- id: build-image
  apply:
    component: outerloop-build
- id: k8s-deployment
  apply:
    component: outerloop-deployment
- id: k8s-service
  apply:
    component: outerloop-service
- id: k8s-url
  apply:
    component: outerloop-url
```

Add the Docker image location and Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources to `components`:
```yaml
components:

# This will build the container image before deployment
- name: outerloop-build
  image:
    dockerfile:
      buildContext: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      rootRequired: false
      uri: ./Dockerfile
    imageName: "{{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}"

# This will create a Deployment in order to run your container image across
# the cluster.
- name: outerloop-deployment
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
                image: {{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}
                ports:
                  - name: http
                    containerPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
                    protocol: TCP
                resources:
                  limits:
                    memory: "1024Mi"
                    cpu: "500m"

# This will create a Service so your Deployment is accessible.
# Depending on your cluster, you may modify this code so it's a
# NodePort, ClusterIP or a LoadBalancer service.
- name: outerloop-service
  kubernetes:
    inlined: |
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:
        ports:

          targetPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
        selector:
          app: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
        type: ClusterIP
```

To be able to access our application let's add one more `component` to the Devfile.
For OpenShift cluster we add Route. For Kubernetes cluster we add Ingress.

        port:
          targetPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3. Run the `odo deploy` command

Now we're ready to run `odo deploy`:

```console
$ odo deploy

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

#### 1. Containerize the application

In order to deploy our application, we must containerize it in order to build and push to a registry. Create the following `Dockerfile` in the same directory:

```dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/dotnet-60:6.0 as builder
WORKDIR /opt/app-root/src
COPY --chown=1001 . .

COPY --from=builder /opt/app-root/src/bin /opt/app-root/src/bin
WORKDIR /opt/app-root/src/bin/Release/net6.0/publish
CMD ["dotnet", "app.dll"]
```

#### 2. Modify the Devfile

Let's modify the `devfile.yaml` and add the respective deployment code.

:::caution

To be able to access our application we need to add one more `component` to the Devfile.
For OpenShift cluster we add Route. For Kubernetes cluster we add Ingress.

#### 3. Run the `odo deploy` command

Now we're ready to run `odo deploy`:

```console
$ odo deploy
  __
 /  \__     Deploying the application using my-dotnet-app Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: default
 /  \__/    odo version: v3.0.0-alpha2

Your Devfile has been successfully deployed
```

Your application has now been deployed to the Kubernetes cluster with Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources.

Test your application by visiting the `DOMAIN_NAME` variable that you had set in the `devfile.yaml`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java (Spring Boot)">

#### 1. Containerize the application

In order to deploy our application, we must containerize it in order to build and push to a registry. Create the following `Dockerfile` in the same directory:

```dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11 as builder

USER jboss
WORKDIR /tmp/src
COPY --chown=jboss . /tmp/src
RUN mvn package

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11
COPY --from=builder /tmp/src/target/*.jar /deployments/app.jar
```

#### 2. Modify the Devfile

Let's modify the `devfile.yaml` and add the respective deployment code.

:::caution
When copy/pasting to `devfile.yaml`, make sure the lines you inserted are correctly indented.
:::

`odo deploy` uses Devfile schema **2.2.0**. Change the schema to reflect the change:

```yaml
# Deploy "kind" ID's use schema 2.2.0+
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
```

Add the `variables` section:

```yaml
# Add the following variables code anywhere in devfile.yaml
# This MUST be a container registry you are able to access
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: quay.io/MYUSERNAME/java-springboot-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-java-springboot-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "8080"
  DOMAIN_NAME: java-springboot.example.com
```

Add the commands used to deploy:

```yaml
# This is the main "composite" command that will run all below commands
commands:
- id: deploy
  composite:
    commands:
    - build-image
    - k8s-deployment
    - k8s-service
    - k8s-url
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: deploy

# Below are the commands and their respective components that they are "linked" to deploy
- id: build-image
  apply:
    component: outerloop-build
- id: k8s-deployment
  apply:
    component: outerloop-deployment
- id: k8s-service
  apply:
    component: outerloop-service
- id: k8s-url
  apply:
    component: outerloop-url
```

Add the Docker image location as well as Kubernetes Deployment and Service resources to `components`:
```yaml
components:

# This will build the container image before deployment
- name: outerloop-build
  image:
    dockerfile:
      buildContext: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
      rootRequired: false
      uri: ./Dockerfile
    imageName: "{{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}"

# This will create a Deployment in order to run your container image across
# the cluster.

#### (OPTIONAL) 4. Delete the resources

After testing your application, you may optionally undeploy using the `odo delete component` command:

```console
odo delete component
Searching resources to delete, please wait...
This will delete "my-app" from the namespace "default".
 •  The component contains the following resources that will get deleted:
        - Deployment: my-app
        - Service: my-app
        - Ingress: my-app
? Are you sure you want to delete "my-app" and all its resources? Yes
The component "my-app" is successfully deleted from namespace "default"
 •  There are still resources left in the cluster that might be belonging to the deleted component.
        - Endpoints: svc
        - Service: svc
If you want to delete those, execute `odo delete component --name my-app --namespace default`
```
