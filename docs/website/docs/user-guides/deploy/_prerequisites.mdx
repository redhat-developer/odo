**Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, you must login to a container registry that we will be pushing our application to.

Login to your container registry with either `podman` or `docker`:

```console
podman login
```
Or
```console
docker login
```

In order for `odo deploy` to push your image, your container registry needs to be accessible.


**NOTE for MacOS:** If you are running Apple Silicon (M1/M2), you must set your Docker build platform to the cluster you are deploying to.

For example, if you are deploying to `linux/amd64`:

```console
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64  
```
