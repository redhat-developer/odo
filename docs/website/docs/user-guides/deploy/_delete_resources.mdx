After testing your application, you may optionally undeploy using the `odo delete component` command:

```console
odo delete component
```
```console
$ odo delete component
Searching resources to delete, please wait...
This will delete "myapp" from the namespace "default".
 •  The component contains the following resources that will get deleted:
        - Deployment: myapp
        - Service: myapp
        - Ingress: myapp
? Are you sure you want to delete "myapp" and all its resources? Yes
The component "myapp" is successfully deleted from namespace "default"
 •  There are still resources left in the cluster that might be belonging to the deleted component.
        - Endpoints: svc
        - Service: svc
If you want to delete those, execute `odo delete component --name myapp --namespace default`
```
