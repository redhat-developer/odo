:::note
Depending upon the container registry specified in the `devfile.yaml`, the access for container image
pushed by `odo deploy` may be private by default. For example: images pushed to [Quay.io](https://quay.io). Change the
image visibility appropriately in order to run `odo deploy` successfully.
