## Description

### Overview

We use the latest [Devfile 2.2.0 reference](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/devfile-schema) in `odo`.

Below are `odo`-specific examples regarding the Devfile reference. Everything we have listed below is implemented in the current version of `odo`.

This API Reference uses examples and snippets to help you create your own `devfile.yaml` file for your project.

For this reference, we use one singular (working) Node.js example which can be ran from your own environment.

### How `odo` Creates Resources from Devfile

When `odo dev` is ran, `odo` creates the following Kubernetes resources from `container` (component) and `exec` (command) sections of the Devfile:
* Deployment for running the containers
* Service for accessibility

See [How odo dev translates a container component into Kubernetes resources](./architecture/how-odo-works.md#how-odo-dev-translates-a-container-component-into-kubernetes-resources) for more details.

### File Synchronization

We use the "inner-loop" process intensively in order to propagate and see changes immediately so you spend less time deploying, and more time writing code. 

Below is the loop that `odo` uses for file synchronization:

1. Deployment and Service resources are created (or updated) on the Kubernetes cluster
2. Files are transfered over to the running container using the Kubernetes API 
3. `odo` watches for file changes locally and repeats Step 1 and 2.

The "loop" is cancelled once the user inputs Ctrl+C.

#### Hot Reloading

`hotReloadCapable` is a special boolean within `exec` that allows you to specify if a framework is "hot reloadable".

If set to `true`, the container won't be restarted as the framework will handle file changes on its own.

#### Full Example

```yaml
commands:
  - exec:
      commandLine: yarn dev
      component: runtime
      group:
        isDefault: true
        kind: run
      hotReloadCapable: true
      workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
    id: build
```


### What Commands are Executed in Dev or Deploy

Each command has a group `kind`:

```yaml
- exec:
    commandLine: npm start
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: run
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: run
```

When `odo dev` is executed, we use: build, run, test and debug.

These commands are typically ran within the `container` component that has been defined.

The order in which the commands are ran for `odo dev` are:

0. The source code is synchronized to the container
1. `build`: We build the program from the sources
2. `test`: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
3. `run`: The application is ran within the container
4. `debug`: This is ran when `odo dev --debug` is executed

When `odo deploy` is executed, we use: `deploy`.

These commands are typically tied to Kubernetes or OpenShift inline resources. They are defined as a component. However, you can use `container` or `image` components as well under the `deploy` group.

The most common deploy scenario is the following:
1. Use the `image` component to build a container
2. Deploy a `kubernetes` component(s) with a Kubernetes resource defined

### How `odo` runs exec commands in Deploy mode
```yaml
commands:
  - id: deploy-db
    exec:
      commandLine: |
        helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami && \
        helm install my-db bitnami/postgresql
      component: runtime
  - id: deploy
    composite:
      commands:
      - app-image
      - deploy-app
      - deploy-db
      group:
        kind: deploy
        isDefault: true

components:
  - container:
      endpoints:
        - name: http-3000
          targetPort: 3000
      image: quay.io/tkral/devbox-demo-devbox
      memoryLimit: 1024Mi
      mountSources: true
      sourceMapping: /project
    name: runtime
```

In the example above, `exec` command is a part of the composite deploy command.

Every `exec` command must correspond to a container component command.

`exec` command can be used to execute any command, which makes it possible to use tools such as [Helm](https://helm.sh/), [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), etc. in the development workflow with odo, given that the binary is made available by the image of the container component that is referenced by the command.

Commands defined by the `exec` command are run inside a container started by a [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). Every `exec` command references a Devfile container component. `odo` makes use of this container component definition to define the Kubernetes Job.

`odo` takes into account the complete container definition which includes any `endpoints` exposed, `env` variables exported, `memoryLimit`, `cpuLimit`, `memoryRequest`, or `cpuRequest` imposed, or any source mounting (`mountSources`) and mapping (`sourceMapping`) to be done (this feature is yet to be implemented, see [#6658](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6658)); the only thing it overwrites is `command` and `args`; which are taken from the `exec` command's `commandLine`. Every command uses `/bin/sh` as an entrypoint.

`odo` also takes into account the complete command definition which includes setting any `env` variables, and using the given `workingDir`; this works similarly to how commands are run in Dev mode.

#### Kubernetes Job Specification
1. The naming convention for the Kubernetes Job is `<component-name>-app-<command-id>`; the maximum character limit for a resource name allowed by Kubernetes is 63, but since this resource is created by `odo`, we do not want the character limit to be any issue to the user, and so we use a max character limit of 60.
2. If the Kubernetes Job fails to run the command the first time, it will retry one more time before giving up ([`BackOffLimit`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-backoff-failure-policy)).
3. If the Kubernetes Job succeeds, but `odo` is unable to delete it for some reason, it will be automatically deleted after 60 seconds ([`TTLSecondsAfterFinished`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#ttl-mechanism-for-finished-jobs)).
4. The Kubernetes Job is created with appropriate annotations and labels so that it can be deleted by `odo delete component --name <name>` command if the need be.
5. If the Kubernetes Job fails, a new pod is created to re-run the job instead of re-running it inside the same pod's container, this ensures that we can fetch the logs when needed.

### How `odo` determines components that are applied automatically

When running `odo dev` or `odo deploy`, `odo` determines components that need to be applied automatically by looking at several things:
- whether the component is referenced by any [`apply` commands](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-an-apply-command);
- and looking at dedicated fields that allow to explicitly control this behavior:
  - `autoBuild` on [Image components](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-an-image-component)
  - `deployByDefault` on [Kubernetes or OpenShift components](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-a-kubernetes-or-openshift-component)

#### `autoBuild` for Image Components

An Image component is applied automatically if **any** of the following conditions are met:
- `autoBuild` is `true`
- `autoBuild` is not set, **and** this Image component is not referenced in any `apply` commands

If the Image component is referenced by an `apply` command, it will be applied when this command is invoked.

For example, given the following excerpt:
```yaml
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO: localhost:5000/odo-dev/node

components:
  # autoBuild true => automatically created on startup
  - image:
      autoBuild: true
      dockerfile:
        buildContext: .
        uri: Dockerfile
      imageName: "{{ CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO }}:autobuild-true"
    name: "autobuild-true"

  # autoBuild false, referenced in apply command => created when apply command is invoked
  - image:
      autoBuild: false
      dockerfile:
        buildContext: .
        uri: Dockerfile
      imageName: "{{ CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO }}:autobuild-false-and-referenced"
    name: "autobuild-false-and-referenced"
    
  # autoBuild not set, not referenced in apply command => automatically created on startup
  - image:
      dockerfile:
        buildContext: .
        uri: Dockerfile
      imageName: "{{ CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO }}:autobuild-not-set-and-not-referenced"
    name: "autobuild-not-set-and-not-referenced"

  - container:
      image: "{{ CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO }}:autobuild-not-set-and-not-referenced"
    name: runtime
commands:
  - apply:
      component: autobuild-false-and-referenced
    id: image-autobuild-false-and-referenced
 
  - composite:
      commands:
        - image-autobuild-false-and-referenced
        - start-app
      group:
        isDefault: true
        kind: run
    id: run

  - composite:
      commands:
        - image-autobuild-false-and-referenced
        - deploy-k8s
      group:
        isDefault: true
        kind: deploy
    id: deploy
```

When running `odo`, the following Image components will be applied automatically, before applying any other components and invoking any commands:
- `autobuild-true` because it has `autoBuild` set to `true`.
- `autobuild-not-set-and-not-referenced` because it doesn't set `autoBuild` and is not referenced by any `apply` commands.

Because the `image` component `autobuild-false-and-referenced` is referenced by the `apply` command `image-autobuild-false-and-referenced`, it will be applied when this command
is invoked, that is, in this example, when the `run` or `deploy` commands are invoked.


#### `deployByDefault` for Kubernetes/OpenShift Components

A Kubernetes or OpenShift component is applied automatically if **any** of the following conditions are met:
- `deployByDefault` is `true`
- `deployByDefault` is not set, **and** this component is not referenced in any `apply` commands

If the component is referenced by an `apply` command, it will be applied when this command is invoked.

For example, given the following excerpt (simplified to use only Kubernetes components, but the same behavior applies to OpenShift ones):
```yaml
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO: localhost:5000/odo-dev/node

components:
  # deployByDefault true => automatically created on startup
  - kubernetes:
      deployByDefault: true
      inlined: |
        [...]
    name: "k8s-deploybydefault-true"

  # deployByDefault false, referenced in apply command => created when apply command is invoked
  - kubernetes:
      deployByDefault: false
      inlined: |
        [...]
    name: "k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced"
    
  # deployByDefault not set, not referenced in apply command => automatically created on startup
  - kubernetes:
      inlined: |
        [...]
    name: "k8s-deploybydefault-not-set-and-not-referenced"

  - container:
      image: "{{ CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO }}:autobuild-not-set-and-not-referenced"
    name: runtime
commands:
  - apply:
      component: k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced
    id: apply-k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced
 
  - composite:
      commands:
        - apply-k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced
        - start-app
      group:
        isDefault: true
        kind: run
    id: run

  - composite:
      commands:
        - apply-k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced
        - deploy-k8s
      group:
        isDefault: true
        kind: deploy
    id: deploy
```

When running `odo`, the following Kubernetes components will be applied automatically, before applying any other components and invoking any commands:
- `k8s-deploybydefault-true` because it has `deployByDefault` set to `true`.
- `k8s-deploybydefault-not-set-and-not-referenced` because it doesn't set `deployByDefault` and is not referenced by any `apply` commands.

Because the `kubernetes` component `k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced` is referenced by the `apply` command `apply-k8s-deploybydefault-false-and-referenced` , it will be applied when this command
is invoked, that is, in this example, when the `run` or `deploy` commands are invoked.


## File Reference

This file reference outlines the **major** components of the Devfile API Reference using *snippets* and *examples*.

We use practical approach outlining the details of Devfile. The example is a modified version from [registry/nodejs](https://github.com/devfile/registry/blob/main/stacks/nodejs/devfile.yaml) on GitHub for demonstration purposes.

In this example, we are deploying a full Node.js application that is available through both `odo dev` and `odo deploy`. 

For a more in-depth detailed outline of Devfile, please refer to the official [Devfile 2.2.0 reference](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/devfile-schema).

**NOTE:** Some portions of the Devfile examples are commented out to show what is *available* but it does not apply to the practical example.

### Special Variables

There are two special variables available to use in `devfile.yaml`:
* `$PROJECTS_ROOT`: A path where projects sources are mounted as defined by container component's sourceMapping.
* `$PROJECT_SOURCE`: A path to a project source (`$PROJECTS_ROOT/`). If there are multiple projects, this will point to the directory of the first one.

These are helpful when defining or using multiple sources during development or deployment.

### `schemaVersion`

> `type: string` | **required**

Devfile schema version. This outlines what version of the schema `odo` will use and validate against.

#### Full Example

```yaml
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
```

### `metadata`

> `type: object` | **required**

The metadata of the Devfile describes what the following Devfile is about. Information displayed here is helpful to figure out what the project does.

#### Full Example

We are describing a simple Node.js app. This information is displayed when running `odo registry`.

```yaml
metadata:
  description: Stack with Node.js 14
  name: my-nodejs-app
  displayName: Node.js Runtime
  icon: https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs-new-pantone-black.svg
  language: javascript
  projectType: nodejs
  tags:
  - NodeJS
  - Express
  - ubi8
  version: 1.0.1
```

### `starterProjects`

> `type: object` | **optional**

StarterProjects is a project that can be used as a starting point when bootstrapping new projects.

When running `odo init`, `odo` looks at the `starterProjects` object to see if there are any available to initially generate.

We support using both `git` and `zip` file formats.

#### Full Example

We will use the starter project from [odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex](https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex) on GitHub.

```yaml
starterProjects:
- git:
    remotes:
      origin: https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex.git
    # You can also checkout from a specific remote as well as revision / tag
    # checkoutFrom:
    #  remote: subproject
    #  revision: 1.1.0Final
    
    # As well as a subdirectory
    # subDir: demo
  name: nodejs-starter

# Alternatively, you can also provide a zipfile location
- zip:
    location: https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex/archive/refs/tags/0.0.2.zip
  name: nodejs-zip-starter
```

### `variables`

> `type: object` | **optional**

Map of key-value variables used for string replacement in the Devfile.

This is important so that you can easily replace variables and make Devfile more *portable* between different environments.

#### Full Example

**NOTE:** For the below example to run correctly, change the `CONTAINER_IMAGE` to an accessible container registry.

```yaml
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: quay.io/MYUSERNAME/nodejs-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-nodejs-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "3000"
  DOMAIN_NAME: nodejs.example.com
```


### `commands`
> `type: object` | **required**

Predefined, ready-to-use, devworkspace-related commands

Each command is categorized into five groups: build, run, test, debug and deploy.

For `odo dev`, we use: build, run, test and debug.

For `odo deploy`, we use: deploy.

For each command categorized, there are three different "properties" you can use, either: `exec`, `apply` or `composite`:
  * `exec`: A CLI command is executed inside an existing component container
  * `apply`: A command that consists of "applying" a component definition. Typically Kubernetes inline code.
  * `composite`: A composite command that allows executing several sub-commands either sequentially or concurrently

Each command is ran at different points of `odo`'s execution and is further explained [here](#what-commands-are-executed-in-dev-or-deploy).

#### Full Example using `odo dev` capabilities

In the below example, we showcase what commands we would run for `odo dev`:

```yaml

# We will go into detail on the "build" part
# 
# All of these commands are ran in a *container* and at different stages
# of `odo dev`
commands:
- exec:
    # The command you want to run
    commandLine: npm install

    # Which component we are using to run the above command
    # The component contains the container image we are using
    component: runtime

    # What group we are running this in, in our case it's "build"
    group:

      # Identifies the default command for a given group kind as there can be multiple
      # exec's for one kind
      isDefault: true
      # Executes in the "build" stage of dev
      kind: build

    # The working directory being used (see "Special Variables")
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}

  # The to refer to
  id: install

# Executes in the "run" stage of dev
- exec:
    commandLine: npm start
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: run
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: run

# Executes in the "debug" stage of dev
- exec:
    commandLine: npm run debug
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: debug
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: debug

# Executes in the "test" stage of dev
- exec:
    commandLine: npm test
    component: runtime
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: test
    workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
  id: test
```

#### Full Example using `odo deploy` capabilities

In the below example, we showcase what commands we would run for `odo deploy`:

```yaml
# This is the main "composite" command that will run all below commands
commands:
- id: deploy
  composite:
    # In this composite, we will run the following commands:
    commands:
    - build-image
    - k8s-deployment
    - k8s-service
    - k8s-ingress
    
    # This is part of the deploy group and will be executed when running `odo deploy`
    group:
      isDefault: true
      kind: deploy

# In order to run all the commands under composite, we must also define each command:
# Below are the commands and their respective components that they are "linked" to deploy
- id: build-image
  # In this case, we will apply the following outerloop-build component 
  apply:
    component: outerloop-build

- id: k8s-deployment
  apply:
    component: outerloop-deployment
- id: k8s-service
  apply:
    component: outerloop-service
- id: k8s-ingress
  apply:
    component: outerloop-ingress
```

### `components`

> `type: object` | **required**

List of the devworkspace components, such as editor and plugins, user-provided containers, or other types of components.

Each component can be as simple as container to a full Kubernetes inline object.

There are four different kinds of components:
* `container`: Allows adding and configuring devworkspace-related containers
* `image`: Allows specifying the definition of an image for outer loop builds
* `kubernetes`: Allows importing into the devworkspace the Kubernetes resources defined in a given manifest
* `openshift`: Allows importing into the devworkspace the OpenShift resources defined in a given manifest 

#### Full Example using `odo dev` capabilities

In the below example, we utilize one container component for all `odo dev` commands (build, run, test and debug):

```yaml
components:
- container:
    # A list of all endpoints to be used.
    endpoints:
    - name: http-3000
      targetPort: 3000

    # The container image
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-14:latest

    # Arguments to be passed into the container by default
    # args: "foo", "bar"

    # The default command to be ran
    # command: "foo", "bar"

    # Environment variables to be passed into the container
    # env:
    #  HELLO: WORLD

    # Limits that can be set
    memoryLimit: 1024Mi
    # memoryRequest: 2048Mi
    # cpuRequest: 250m
    # cpuLimit: 500m

    # Specify if a container should run in its own separated pod, instead of running as part of the main development environment pod.
    # By default, this is set to false
    dedicatedPod: false

    # Annotations can also be passed in too to the Deployment and Service created by this container
    # annotation:
    #   service:
    #     FOO: BAR
    #   deployment:
    #     FOO: BAR

    # You can also mount for persistent storage. In our case, we'll create "myvol" which mounts to /data
    # Creating a mount, you will also need to create a "myvol" volume component
    # volumeMounts:
    #  - name: myvol
    #    path: /data

    # Toggles whether or not the project source code should be mounted in the component
    # By default, this is set to true
    mountSources: true

    # Optional specification of the path in the container where project sources should be transferred/mounted when mountSources is true. When omitted, the default value of /projects is used.
    # sourceMapping: /projects

  # The name of the component
  name: runtime

# In our commented example, if we were to use a volume, we would add the following to our component list:
# - name: myvol
#   volume:
#     size: 3Gi
```

#### Full Example using `odo deploy` capabilities

In the below example, we implement a image component as well as multiple Kubernetes inline resources for our `odo deploy` scenario:

```yaml
components:
# This will build AND push the container image locally before deployment
- name: outerloop-build
  image:

    # Here we provide the Dockerfile that we are going to be using
    dockerfile:

      # Where the Dockerfile will be built
      buildContext: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}

      # If root is going to be required or not
      rootRequired: false

      # Now we point to where the Dockerfile is located
      # Here we can either provide: URI, Git or a Devfile Registry
      uri: ./Dockerfile

    # Provide the image name to be used, in our case, we use the image name from `variables:`
    imageName: "{{CONTAINER_IMAGE}}"
    
    # For auto build, you can define if an image should be built during startup
    # autoBuild: false

# This will create a Deployment in order to run your container image across
# the cluster. We provide raw Kubernetes yaml inlined into our devfile.yaml
- name: outerloop-deployment
  kubernetes:

    # Below we provide the inline code for our Deployment
    inlined: |
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: {{RESOURCE_NAME}}
      spec:

                  - name: http
                    containerPort: {{CONTAINER_PORT}}
                    protocol: TCP
                resources:
                  limits:
                    memory: "1024Mi"
                    cpu: "500m"

# This will create a Service so your Deployment is accessible.
# Depending on your cluster, you may modify this code so it's a
# NodePort, ClusterIP or a LoadBalancer service.
