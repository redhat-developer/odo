[[overview]]
== Overview

`odo`  is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Existing tools such as `kubectl` and `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer.

[[key-features]]
== Key features

`odo` is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
* Completely client based. No additional server other than Kubernetes or OpenShift is required for deployment.
* Official support for Node.js and Java components.
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real time.
* Lists all the available components and services from the cluster.

Learn more about the features provided by odo on link:https://odo.dev/docs/getting-started/features[odo.dev].

[[core-concepts]]
== Core concepts

Project::
A project is your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.
Application::
An application is a program designed for end users. An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application.
Examples of applications: e-Shop, Hotel Reservation System, Online Booking
Component::
A component is a set of Kubernetes resources which host code or data. Each component can be run and deployed separately.
Examples of components: Warehouse API Backend, Inventory API, Web Frontend, Payment Backend
Service::
A service is software that your component links to or depends on.
Examples of services: MariaDB, MySQL.
Devfile::
A portable file responsible for your entire reproducible development environment.

[[usage-data]]
== Usage data

When odo is run the first time, you will be asked to opt-in to Red Hat's telemetry collection program.

With your approval, odo will collect pseudonymized usage data and send it to Red Hat servers to help improve our products and services. Read our link:https://developers.redhat.com/article/tool-data-collection[privacy statement] to learn more about it. For the specific data being collected and to configure this data collection process, see link:USAGE_DATA.adoc[Usage data].

Please have a look at our link:docs/dev/development.adoc[Development Guide].
To contribute to the documentation, please have a look at our link:https://odo.dev/docs/contributing/docs/[Documentation Guide].

We work in 3-week sprint cycles. On a week when the sprint starts we have two planning calls:

* "Sprint Planning Preparation and Issue Triage" - on Monday
* "Sprint Planning" - on Wednesday

On top of our sprint planning calls, we have our regular "odo contributors call" (biweekly on Tuesdays). This is where we discuss technical challenges and anything related to odo development.

All our calls are open to public. You are welcome to join any of our calls.

You can find the exact dates of all scheduled odo calls together with sprint dates in the link:https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gi0s0v5ukfqkjpnn26p6va3jfc%40group.calendar.google.com[odo calendar] (link:https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/gi0s0v5ukfqkjpnn26p6va3jfc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics[iCal format]).

To participate in the calls, please join link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/odo-dev[odo-dev Google group]. When you join the group, you will automatically get invites to all odo related calls and get permissions to all necessary documents.
