[[overview]]
== Overview

`odo` is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on OpenShift.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer.

[[key-features]]
== Key features

`odo` is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
* Completely client based. No server is required within the OpenShift cluster for deployment.
* Official support for Node.js and Java components.
* Partial compatibility with languages and frameworks such as Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Python. 
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real time.
* Lists all the available components and services from the {product-title} cluster.

[id="odo-listing-available-images"]
==== Listing available container images

[NOTE]
====
The list of available container images is sourced from the cluster's internal container registry and external registries associated with the cluster.
====

To list the available components and associated container images for your cluster:

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster with {odo-title}:
+
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

. List the available {odo-title} supported and unsupported components and corresponding container images:
+
----------------------------------------------------
$ odo catalog list components
Odo Supported OpenShift Components:
NAME        PROJECT      TAGS      
java       openshift     8,latest
nodejs     openshift     10,8,8-RHOAR,latest
Odo Unsupported OpenShift Components:
NAME                      PROJECT       TAGS
dotnet                    openshift     1.0,1.1,2.1,2.2,latest
fuse7-eap-openshift       openshift     1.3
----------------------------------------------------
+
The `TAGS` column represents the available image versions, for example, `10` represents the `rhoar-nodejs/nodejs-10` container image.

=== Contributing
Want to become a contributor and submit your code?
Please have a look at our link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/docs/dev/development.adoc[Development Guide].

We work in 3-week sprint cycles. On a week when the sprint starts we have two planning calls:

* "Sprint Planning Preparation and Issue Triage" - on Monday
* "Sprint Planning" - on Wednesday

On top of our sprint planning calls, we have our regular "odo contributors call" (biweekly on Tuesdays). This is where we discuss technical challenges and anything related to odo development.

All our calls are open to public. You are welcome to join any of our calls.

You can find the exact dates of all scheduled odo calls together with sprint dates in the link:https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gi0s0v5ukfqkjpnn26p6va3jfc%40group.calendar.google.com[odo calendar] (link:https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/gi0s0v5ukfqkjpnn26p6va3jfc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics[iCal format]).

To participate in the calls, please join link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/odo-dev[odo-dev Google group]. When you join the group, you will automatically get invites to all odo related calls and get permissions to all necessary documents.

Want to try out the odo experimental mode? Please read the link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/docs/dev/experimental-mode.adoc[document] for more information.

[[glossary]]
== Glossary

*Application:* An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application.

*Component:* A component is similar to a microservice. Multiple
components make up an application. A component has different attributes like storage. `odo` supports multiple component types like nodejs, perl, php, python, and ruby.

*Service:* Typically a service is a database or a service that a
component links to or depends on. For example: MariaDB, Jenkins, MySQL.
This comes from the OpenShift Service Catalog and must be enabled within your cluster.
