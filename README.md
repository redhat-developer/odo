### Overview

`odo`  is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Existing tools such as `kubectl` and `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer.

### Key features

`odo` is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
* Completely client based. No additional server other than Kubernetes or OpenShift is required for deployment.
* Official support for Node.js and Java components.
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real time.
* Lists all the available components and services from the cluster.
