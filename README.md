### Overview

`odo` is a fast, and iterative CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Why use `odo`?

* **Fast:** Spend less time maintaining your application deployment infrastructure and more time coding. Immediately have your application running each time you save.
* **Standalone:** `odo` is a standalone tool that communicates directly with the Kubernetes API. There is no requirement for a daemon or server process.
* **No configuration needed:** There is no need to dive into complex Kubernetes yaml configuration files. `odo` abstracts those concepts away and lets you focus on what matters most: code.
* **Containers first:** We provide first class support for both Kubernetes and OpenShift. Choose your favourite container orchestrator and develop your application.
* **Easy to learn:** Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
