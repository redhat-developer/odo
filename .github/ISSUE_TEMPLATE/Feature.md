NOTE: Not filling out the issue template needs a good reason, as otherwise it
may take a lot longer to find the problem, not to mention it can take up a lot
more time which can otherwise be spent on development. Please also take the
time to help us debug the issue by collecting relevant information, even if
it doesn't seem to be relevant to you. Thanks!
