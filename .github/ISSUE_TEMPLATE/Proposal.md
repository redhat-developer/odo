Welcome! - We kindly ask that you:

  1. Fill out the issue template below - not doing so needs a good reason.
  2. Use the chat and talk to us if you have a question rather than a bug or feature request.

The chat room is at: https://chat.openshift.io/developers/channels/odo

NOTE: Not filling out the issue template needs a good reason, as otherwise it
may take a lot longer to find the problem, not to mention it can take up a lot
more time which can otherwise be spent on development. Please also take the
time to help us debug the issue by collecting relevant information, even if
it doesn't seem to be relevant to you. Thanks!

Thanks for understanding, and for contributing to the project!
