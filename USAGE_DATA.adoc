[[usage-data]]
== Usage Data

If the user has consented to `odo` collecting usage data, the following data is collected when a command is executed -

* command's ID
* command's duration time
* command's error message and error type (in case of failure)
* whether the command was run from a terminal
* system information such as OS type
* `odo` version in use


[[enable-disable]]
== Enable/Disable preference

Enable::
`odo preference set ConsentTelemetry true`

Disable::
`odo preference set ConsentTelemetry false`

Note: If earlier the `ConsentTelemetry` preference was enabled, then the data will be collected about the disabling of the preference.

Alternatively you can disable telemetry by setting `ODO_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `true`.
This environment can override `ConsentTelemetry` value set by `odo preference`.
