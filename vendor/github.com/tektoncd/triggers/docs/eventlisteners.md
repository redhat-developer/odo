# EventListener

`EventListener`s connect `TriggerBinding`s to `TriggerTemplate`s and provide an
addressable endpoint, which is where webhooks/events are directed. This is also
where the service account is connected, which specifies what permissions the
resources will be created (or at least attempted) with. The service account must
have the following role bound.

<!-- FILE: examples/role-resources/role.yaml -->

```YAML
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tekton-triggers-example-minimal
rules:
# Permissions for every EventListener deployment to function
- apiGroups: ["tekton.dev"]
  resources: ["eventlisteners", "triggerbindings", "triggertemplates", "tasks", "taskruns"]
  verbs: ["get"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
# Permissions to create resources in associated TriggerTemplates
- apiGroups: ["tekton.dev"]
  resources: ["pipelineruns", "pipelineresources", "taskruns"]
  verbs: ["create"]
```

Note that currently, JSON is the only accepted MIME type for events.

When an `EventListener` is successfully created, a service is created that
references a listener pod. This listener pod accepts the incoming events and
does what has been specified in the corresponding
`TriggerBinding`s/`TriggerTemplate`s. The created service is by default of type
`ClusterIP`; any other pods running in the same Kubernetes cluster can access
services' via their cluster DNS. For external services to connect to your
cluster (e.g. GitHub sending webhooks), check out the guide on
[exposing eventlisteners](./exposing-eventlisteners.md)

When the `EventListener` is created in the different namespace from the trigger
component, `config-logging-triggers` ConfigMap is created for the logging
configuration in the namespace when it doesn't exist. The ConfigMap with the
default configuration can be created by applying
[config-logging.yaml](../config/config-logging.yaml)

`EventListener` `spec.serviceType` can be set to `ClusterIP (default)` |
`NodePort` | `LoadBalancer` to configure the underlying `Service` resource to
make it reachable externally.

## Autogenerated labels

By default, EventListeners will attach the following labels automatically to all
resources created:

| Name                     | Description                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| tekton.dev/eventlistener | Name of the EventListener that generated the resource. |
| tekton.dev/trigger       | Name of the trigger that generated the resource.       |
| tekton.dev/eventid       | UID of the incoming event.                             |

Since the EventListener name and trigger name are used as label values, they
must adhere to the [Kubernetes syntax and character set requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set)
for label values.

## Event Interceptors

Triggers within an `EventListener` can optionally specify interceptors, to
modify the behavior or payload of triggers.

Event Interceptors can take several different forms today:

- Webhook Interceptors
- GitHub Interceptors
- GitLab Interceptors

### Webhook Interceptors

Webhook interceptors allow users to configure an external k8s object which
contains business logic. These are currently specified under the `Webhook`
field, which contains an
[`ObjectReference`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#objectreference-v1-core)
to a Kubernetes Service. If a Webhook interceptor is specified, the
`EventListener` sink will forward incoming events to the service referenced by
the interceptor over HTTP. The service is expected to process the event and
return a response back. The status code of the response determines if the
processing is successful - a 200 response means the interceptor was successful
and that processing should continue, any other status code will halt trigger
processing. The returned body is used as the new event payload by the
EventListener and passed on the `TriggerBinding`. An interceptor has an optional
header field with key-value pairs that will be merged with event headers before
being sent;
[canonical](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/header.go#L214)
names must be specified.

When multiple interceptors are specified, requests are piped through each
interceptor sequentially for processing - e.g. the headers/body of the first
interceptor's response will be sent as the request to the second interceptor. It
is the responsibility of interceptors to preserve header/body data if desired.
The response body and headers of the last interceptor is used for resource
binding/templating.

#### Event Interceptor Services

To be an Event Interceptor, a Kubernetes object should:

- Be fronted by a regular Kubernetes v1 Service over port 80
- Accept JSON payloads over HTTP
- Return a HTTP 200 OK Status if the EventListener should continue processing
  the event
- Return a JSON body back. This will be used by the EventListener as the event
  payload for any further processing. If the interceptor does not need to modify
  the body, it can simply return the body that it received.

    - name: foo-trig
      interceptors:
        - webhook:
            header:
              - name: Foo-Trig-Header1
                value: string-value
              - name: Foo-Trig-Header2
                value:
                  - array-val1
                  - array-val2
            objectRef:
              kind: Service
              name: gh-validate
              apiVersion: v1
              namespace: default
      bindings:
        - name: pipeline-binding
      template:
        name: pipeline-template
```

### GitHub Interceptors

GitHub interceptors contain logic to validate and filter webhooks that come from
GitHub. Supported features include validating webhooks actually came from GitHub
using the logic outlined in GitHub
[documentation](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/), as well as
filtering incoming events.

To use this interceptor as a validator, create a secret string using the method
of your choice, and configure the GitHub webhook to use that secret value.
Create a Kubernetes secret containing this value, and pass that as a reference
to the `github` interceptor.

To use this interceptor as a filter, add the event types you would like to
accept to the `eventTypes` field. Valid values can be found in GitHub
[docs](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events).

The body/header of the incoming request will be preserved in this interceptor's
response.

<!-- FILE: examples/eventlisteners/github-eventlistener-interceptor.yaml -->

```YAML
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EventListener
metadata:
  name: github-listener-interceptor
spec:
  serviceAccountName: tekton-triggers-example-sa
  triggers:
    - name: foo-trig
      interceptors:
        - github:
            secretRef:
              secretName: foo
              secretKey: bar
              namespace: baz
            eventTypes:
              - pull_request
      bindings:
        - name: pipeline-binding
      template:
        name: pipeline-template
```

### GitLab Interceptors

GitLab interceptors contain logic to validate and filter requests that come from
GitLab. Supported features include validating that a webhook actually came from
GitLab, using the logic outlined in GitLab
[documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html),
and to filter incoming events based on the event types. Event types can be found
in GitLab
[documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#events).

To use this interceptor as a validator, create a secret string using the method
of your choice, and configure the GitLab webhook to use that secret value.
Create a Kubernetes secret containing this value, and pass that as a reference
to the `gitlab` interceptor.

To use this interceptor as a filter, add the event types you would like to
accept to the `eventTypes` field.

The body/header of the incoming request will be preserved in this interceptor's
response.

<!-- FILE: examples/eventlisteners/gitlab-eventlistener-interceptor.yaml -->

```YAML
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EventListener
metadata:
  name: gitlab-listener-interceptor
spec:
  serviceAccountName: tekton-triggers-example-sa
  triggers:
    - name: foo-trig
      interceptors:
        - gitlab:
            secretRef:
              secretName: foo
              secretKey: bar
              namespace: baz
            eventTypes:
              - Push Hook
      bindings:
        - name: pipeline-binding
      template:
        name: pipeline-template
```

### CEL Interceptors

CEL interceptors parse expressions to filter requests based on JSON bodies and
request headers, using the [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-go) expression
language.

Supported features include case-insensitive matching on request headers.

The body/header of the incoming request will be preserved in this interceptor's
response.

<!-- FILE: examples/eventlisteners/cel-eventlistener-interceptor.yaml -->

```YAML
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EventListener
metadata:
  name: cel-listener-interceptor
spec:
  serviceAccountName: tekton-triggers-example-sa
  triggers:
    - name: cel-trig
      interceptors:
        - cel:
            filter: "header.match('X-GitHub-Event', 'push')"
      bindings:
      - name: pipeline-binding
      template:
        name: pipeline-template
```

The `expression` must return a `true` value, otherwise the request will be
filtered out.
